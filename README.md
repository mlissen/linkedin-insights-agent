## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Chrome or Chromium browser (Puppeteer will use this)
- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-insights-agent.git
   cd linkedin-insights-agent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add your Anthropic API key:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and add your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Configure your target:**
   Edit `src/main.ts` to change the LinkedIn username and focus topics:
   ```typescript
   const config: ScrapingConfig = {
     linkedinUsername: 'sammckenna1', // Change to your target username
     postLimit: 200,
     focusTopics: ['sales', 'prospecting', 'outreach'], // Customize topics
     outputFormat: 'instructions' // Choose: 'json', 'markdown', or 'instructions'
   };
   ```

5. **Run the analysis:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **LinkedIn Login (if prompted):**
   - The browser will open automatically (non-headless mode)
   - If the profile is private or LinkedIn requires login, you'll see the login page
   - **Log in manually** in the opened browser window using your LinkedIn credentials
   - After logging in, the scraper will continue automatically
   - Your credentials are **never stored** - you're just logging into LinkedIn normally
   - The browser stays open so you can see the scraping progress

7. **Find your results:**
   Results are saved in the `./data/[username]/` directory with three files:
   - `1-knowledge-base.txt` - Comprehensive reference material
   - `2-core-rules.txt` - Key principles to always apply
   - `3-project-instructions.txt` - Concise AI project guidance

## Configuration Options

```typescript

## Important Notes

### LinkedIn Compliance
- The tool respects LinkedIn's robots.txt and rate limits
- Scraping is done with realistic delays to avoid detection
- Only scrapes publicly available posts
- Use responsibly and in compliance with LinkedIn's Terms of Service

### Browser Requirements
- Runs in non-headless mode by default so you can see what's happening
- Requires Chrome/Chromium to be installed (Puppeteer will download it automatically)
- LinkedIn login may be required for private profiles or rate limiting
- Browser window stays open during scraping for transparency and debugging

### Data Privacy
- No login credentials are stored
- All data is saved locally in the `./data` directory
- You control what data is collected and how it's used

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **LinkedIn blocks the request**
   - Try running with longer delays
   - Ensure you're not rate-limited
   - Check if profile is public

2. **No posts found**
   - Verify the LinkedIn username is correct
   - Check if the user has recent posts
   - Ensure profile is public

3. **Low-quality insights**
   - Adjust focus topics to be more specific
   - Increase post limit for more data
   - Check confidence scores in output
