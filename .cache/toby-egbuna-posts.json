    "content": "Founders raising VC make the same two competition mistakes that instantly kill investor interest.1. Say you have no competition? You just told investors you haven't talked to a single customer.2. List competitors without context? You just missed your chance to show billion-dollar potential.After raising my pre-seed, here‚Äôs what I know really works üëáüèæMISTAKE # 1: Saying \"we don't have any competition\"If you‚Äôre solving a problem worth solving, then you have competition. It‚Äôs either other companies or it‚Äôs how your potential customers are currently solving the problem.At Chezie, we started our fundraise claiming that we didn‚Äôt have competition in the community management space, because, technically, we didn‚Äôt; none of the companies we pitched already had a solution in place.BUT, our customers were already using Slack, Google Sheets, and email to manage their groups.After ~20 pitches, we realized that these systems were our real competition.If you tell an investor that you don‚Äôt have competition, they‚Äôre going to think that you‚Äôre either naive or that you haven‚Äôt done customer discovery.MISTAKE # 2: Naming competitors without the investment landscapeI recently worked with a fintech founder building in the private asset space. When I asked about his competition, he initially said this:\"Our competition is Carta and AngelList.\"Cool. So what?You need to go deeper. Specifically, you need to discuss the investment landscape in your industry.Here‚Äôs what we changed his approach to:‚ÄúCarta and AngelList have both grown to billion-dollar companies, but they don't touch [specific asset class]. That's our billion-dollar opportunity.‚ÄùNow investors hear:1. This market already produces unicorns2. There's a specific gap worth billionsThat's how you turn competition into opportunity.THE FIX: Make your competition slide pitch FOR youDon‚Äôt treat competition like a checkbox. Use it to show market validation and your specific angle- The intensity of the problem (how frustrated customers are with the existing solutions)- Market validation (billion-dollar outcomes exist)- Your specific angle (what giants are missing)Your competition slide should make investors think \"this founder sees an opportunity everyone else missed,‚Äù not \"this space is crowded\" or \"this founder is clueless.\"The difference between a polite pass and a partner meeting can come down to how you frame the competition.What competition mistake have you seen kill a pitch? Drop it below - let's save some founders from these traps üëá",

    "content": "Funding will not save your company.It's tempting for founders to believe that $1M pre-seed will solve their startup's challenges.The truth is that raising capital only magnifies existing problems.Here's exactly how I've seen funding destroy startups instead of saving them:1. Broken product developmentYou believe: \"Funding means we can hire engineers and accelerate our roadmap!\"What happens: You don‚Äôt talk to customers (which you can do without funding), so you create features for misaligned customers who eventually leave. You end up with a product entirely built on what you THOUGHT customers wanted instead of what they would actually pay for.2. Wasteful marketing spendYou believe: \"After we raise, we'll invest in advertising and rapidly grow our user base!\"What happens: You burn through cash on paid acquisition, reaching irrelevant audiences because you never invested time in defining your target customer.3. Slow and inconsistent salesYou believe: \"Funding lets us build a sales team and scale our sales organization!\"What happens: You hire sales reps prematurely without mastering founder-led sales. Without a proven playbook, there's no repeatability, and those hires fail. Plus, you increased your burn with these hires, so now that 24 months of runway you had has shrunk to just 6 months.Here's what I've discovered through building Chezie:Venture capital must be treated as fuel for an existing flame, not the spark itself.- Found product-market fit and ready to scale? Raise money to build faster.- Figured out a way to get in front of customers? Raise money so you can do it more frequently and quickly.- Consistently closing deals and surpassed $1M in ARR? Raise money to hire an SDR who now has a playbook to follow.If you‚Äôre still navigating product development, go-to-market, or sales fundamentals (which is entirely normal, by the way), don‚Äôt raise money.Instead, invest the time to solve these first.Abandon the fantasy that venture capital will rescue you. Embrace constraints, put in the work, and then leverage capital as an accelerant.I'm adding one more example of how founders assume funding will save them in the comments!What's the biggest mistake you made (or saw someone make) after raising their first round? Drop it in the comments - your story might save another founder from making the same error.",

Here‚Äôs the process we followed üëáüèæI‚Äôm a firm believer that every founder should launch a friends and family round, even if traditional VC or external funding isn't in your plans.This is your chance to share wealth creation with the people who‚Äôve always supported you.Our approach was methodical ‚Äì here's the step-by-step:1. Contacted our networkI reached out to everyone in my personal network about our fundraising plans and offered them a chance to invest.I emphasized this was completely optional ‚Äì zero pressure to participate.We'd been building Chezie for 2 years, so people already understood what we were doing.2. Opened an RUVWe partnered with our lawyer to establish a roll-up vehicle (RUV) through AngelList.An RUV let‚Äôs people invest like an online purchase.The best part: all investments are consolidated everything into a single cap table entry. First-time founders should prioritize keeping a clean cap table, and the RUV does just that.3. Hosted a private pitchAfter confirming interest, Dumebi Egbuna and I organized a group presentation via Zoom.We approached it as seriously as a VC meeting. We covered:- Market problem and our solution- Revenue forecasts- Competitive landscape- Customer acquisition strategy+ other components of our pitch.Around 20 people joined. We concluded with a comprehensive Q&A session. The RUV link went out immediately after.4. Followed up and got the checksFor the following two months, I personally answered every question that folks had. Their belief in us meant everything, and I wanted everyone to feel confident about their decision.Some people invested $1,000 (this is the minimum you can do on an RUV). Some invested $10,000+.One friend invested, got a raise at her job, and invested some more üò≠When we closed the RUV, our support circle had invested over $160k!Honestly, thinking about it is STILL crazy to me.Combined with our VC and other funding sources, we hit our goal for the round.Too many first-time founders skip friends and family rounds, assuming their network lacks interest or resources.My recommendation is to trust your community to make their own choices.Your day-one supporters have earned the opportunity to participate. Honor them by making this investment option available.I wrote a complete guide to raising a friends and family round. Click Visit my store at the top of this post to download it for free ü§ùüèæ",

Open LinkedIn and go to your Connections.2. Click Filter. Scroll to the Title field and filter for ‚Äúangel‚Äù3. Identify any angels that live in your geography4. Add the results to a spreadsheet with these columns: Name, LinkedIn URL5. Repeat steps 1-3 for the keyword ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù6. Identify your top 5 closest professional connections7. Go to their LinkedIn profiles, and click into their Connections8. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for this person‚Äôs Connections9. Add a column to your spreadsheet for Connection10. For each angel you find through your connection‚Äôs network, add them to your spreadsheet and note which of your connections knows them (this will be your warm intro path)‚úì You just found 75-100 angel investors you can contact.Days 4-7 - Research1. Starting with the first investor in your spreadsheet, go to their LinkedIn2. Write down 3 relevant facts about the investor. Consider college, previous work experience, recent posts, etc.3. For that same investor, go to Google and search: ‚Äú[name] angel investments‚Äù4. Include any results in your relevant facts for that angel5.

    "content": "A VC told me I should \"always be raising\" as a startup founder.Here's why that advice is wrong and why founders should prioritize funding readiness instead.TRADITIONAL ADVICE: \"ALWAYS BE RAISING\"Usually, founders think this means \"attend every VC networking event and take every coffee meeting with a VC that you can.‚ÄùThree problems with this:1. Simply put: it‚Äôs exhausting.2. It means that you‚Äôre spending time you could be building your company on talking to VCs when you don‚Äôt need to.3. It forces founders to look at VC as the only path to funding, which just isn‚Äôt true.After securing over $1.2M in total funding for Chezie, I realized that first-time founders shouldn‚Äôt focus on always raising; they should focus on funding readiness.FUNDING READINESS:Funding readiness is about having a line of sight to multiple sources of funding that are ready when you need them.Last year, we were within 6 months of going out of business. Fortunately, I was funding ready.I had established relationships with multiple funding platforms (none of which were VCs because I knew that wasn‚Äôt a path to quick cash).When it was time to tap into these funding sources, we locked down:‚Üí $100K loan from Invest Atlanta‚Üí $25K revenue-based financing‚Üí A $100K line of credit via invoice factoringAll secured within 6 weeks.WHY THIS WORKS:Staying funding-ready is much less time-consuming than always raising, and it lets you stay at a point of leverage.Remember, you never want to be looking for money when you desperately need it. Get money like this üñïüèæ, not like this üôèüèæ.Funding readiness might be:- Sending monthly investor updates to VCs you want to raise from in the future- Attending at most ONE investor mixer per monthBut it might also look like:- Applying for grants every month- Researching loan options for startups in your cityFunding comes in many forms. The best founders optimize for optionality, not just VC money.Stop thinking \"always be raising\" means endless investor meetings and start building your funding readiness across multiple channels.What's your biggest challenge with funding strategy?

    "content": "I spoke to 4 angel investors who've invested in 75+ startups.Founders dramatically underestimate the number of angels required to close an angel round.Here's how to calculate how many angels you need in your target list üëáüèæMost first-time founders believe they can secure a $250K angel round by simply talking to 10 angels.Wrong. Try doubling that.THE ASSUMPTIONS:For a typical $250K angel round:- Average check size: $25K- # of checks needed: 10- Reply rate from quality outreach: 30%- Meeting-to-close rate (percentage of meetings that turn into a check): 20%Note: From my conversations, if an angel replies to your outreach, you'll likely get a meeting. Legitimate angels receive 10-20 pitches daily, so a response indicates genuine interest.THE FUNNEL:Working backwards from 10 checks at $25K each:1. 10 checks needed √∑ 20% close rate = 50 angels to pitch2. 50 meetings needed √∑ 30% reply rate = 170 angels to contactThat's right. You need 170 angels on your target list.KEY TAKEAWAYS:1. Raising from angels is a sales process. If you‚Äôre raising from angels, you must become a salesperson and treat that 170 number as your quota.2. Every angel I spoke with cited poor outreach as the #1 reason they ignore founders. Do your research. Don't pitch healthcare-focused angels when you're building a construction company.3. Angels move faster than VCs because they don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs approval. If you're aggressive and prepared, you can close an angel round in 6 weeks vs. 6 months for VC.THE REALITY:This math might seem daunting, but it should actually be encouraging.170 quality outreach messages over 6 weeks is doable if you are diligent and follow a process.The key is treating it like the sales process it is.Stop thinking you can \"casually\" raise from angels. Start building that target list of 170+ and get to work.- - -P.S. - Next Wednesday, I‚Äôm publishing my findings in a guide for founders looking to raise from angels!Click the Visit my Store button at the top of this post to subscribe for free or comment \"ANGELS\" below and I'll send it to you directly ü§ùüèæ\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

But before my first $100K win, I wasted hours rewriting the same answers‚Äîand still got rejected.If I were a founder starting from 0, here‚Äôs the process I‚Äôd follow to win my first grant üëáüèæLOG COMMON RESPONSES1. Find three open grants.2. Copy and paste the questions from each grant into a document.3. Use ChatGPT to consolidate the questions into one clean document. These are your CQGs (commonly grant questions).4. Write thoughtful responses to each of these questions in the doc from step 3.5. Congratulations. You now have a CGQ database.APPLYING STRATEGICALLY6. Using my CGQ database, respond to the application questions for the three grants you found in step 1.7. Identify questions from these applications that are not in your CGQ database. Respond to them and add them to your database.8. Submit the 3 applications.9. Open a spreadsheet (I suggest Notion)10. Create a sheet with the following columns: Application name, Due date, Amount, Application status (Not started, In progress, Submitted), Application URL11. Congratulations, you have a grant application tracker.12. Add each of the three grants from step 1 to your tracker.13. Go to your calendar.14. Create 2 weekly time blocks- Block 1: 15 mins: Find grants and add them to your tracker- Block 2: 45 mins: apply to grants15. Every week, review the new grants in your tracker and submit the corresponding applications. Do as many as you can in 45 minutes. Refer to your CGQ database from step 5 to apply more efficiently.16. Repeat weekly until you reach profitability (it‚Äôs much harder to get grants when you don‚Äôt *really* need the money).If you‚Äôre consistent and you make steady progress with your company, you will win non-dilutive grant money to grow faster.P.S. - I made my Grant Application Tracker available for free for founders looking to win their first grant.

We‚Äôre raising $750K to hire engineers to move off of no-code\"Sounds solid, right?Nope. 20 meetings and 0 checks in, I realized I was making a big mistake.I was telling investors how I'd use their money, not how they'd make money.MILESTONE-FOCUSED PITCH:Once I understood venture math, everything changed.My new pitch:\"We're at $100K ARR with seven customers, and our product is a no-code MVP. With $750K, we'll grow to $1M ARR in 15 months - which will allow us to raise our seed round at 2-3x our current valuation.\"WHY THIS WORKS:Pre-seed investors aren‚Äôt investing in today‚Äôs version of your company.They‚Äôre investing in what your company can become. They need to believe that in 12-18 months, you can raise another round at a 2-3x valuation.That means if you‚Äôre raising at a $6M valuation today, your job is to convince investors that you‚Äôll be able to raise at (at least) a $12M valuation down the road.Why do you have to double your valuation?Because VCs need to show their LPs (limited partners; the people who give them money to invest) that they're picking good companies.Happy LPs = more money for the next fund.TAKEAWAY:When fundraising, your job as a founder isn't to show investors your great company.Your only job is to convince them you'll hit the milestones to raise your next round at a higher valuation.The other parts of your pitch (team, product, GTM, etc.) are just there to support the story.What‚Äôs your biggest challenge with fundraising?

    "content": "The biggest mistake I made building my first startup was falling in love with my own idea.It cost me $10K and 1.5 years.Here's how to avoid building something nobody wants to pay for üëáMy co-founder and I spent 1.5 years and $15K of our own money building a job review platform for minorities.Our goal was to create a Glassdoor for us.At the time, I thought that this was something that just had to exist. If we build it, they'll come.Wrong.After 1.5 years, we had to face reality:- 1 paying customer- $400 MRR- 1500 job-seekers but 0 willing to payNeither businesses nor job-seekers would PAY for our platform. They appreciated it, but no one would open their checkbook.Then something unexpected happened.A friend reached out asking if we could help with their ERGs. They had $35K to spend - almost 10x more than we'd ever made working on the job review platform.We pivoted, and within a month of launching as Chezie, we had a 5-figure contract.If I were to start a new company, here's how I'd approach building product:1. Start with customer painTalk to 20+ potential customers. My favorite questions to ask:‚Ä¢ How are you solving that problem today?‚Ä¢ Have you looked for a better solution recently?2. Validate willingness to pay by SELLING (Most important)Here's what I learned after 300+ customer calls:\"I love this idea\" = worthless\"When can I buy?\" = close, but we can do better\"Here's my credit card\" = validationYou have to ask people to pay for your solution. That‚Äôs the only validation that matters.Best case? They buy on the spot.Worst case? They end the call and block you.Either way, you get feedback that helps you understand if you're on the right path.You have to ask people to pay for it early. Words are nice, but a Stripe payment is much better.(Check out Rob Snyder's content for how to find demand by selling)---Don't make the same mistake I did.Focus on learning about your customers first.Building the product becomes way easier when you know exactly what pain you're solving and how much people will pay to fix it.How do you think about building product?P.S. - Want the exact framework I use to validate ideas by selling?

    "content": "I wasted weeks cold emailing VCs for my pre-seed when I should have focused on getting warm intros.If I had no network but still needed to raise, here's exactly how I'd engineer my first 10 warm intros üëáüèæ1. Build my target list of 300+ VCs.2. Prioritize the funds in that list to identify the top 10% (30 funds) that I wanted to raise from based on connections, thesis, brand, similar investments, etc.3. Filter by target list for only these 30 funds4. Go to Crunchbase5. Starting with the first of the 30 funds, search for that fund on Crunchbase6. Look at the fund‚Äôs three most recent investments7. Write down the names, websites, and founders for the 3 most recent investments8. Repeat steps 5-7 for the remaining 29 high-priority funds9. Open LinkedIn10. Send a connection request to the founders of every portfolio company. (Use the template in the image below)11. Open your email12. Send an email to each founder (their email is probably firstname@website.com) asking if they‚Äôd be open to sharing their experience working with the Fund you‚Äôre considering. (Use the template in the image below)13. Schedule and conduct the meetings, asking genuine questions about their founder experience and their relationship with the fund.14. At the end of the meeting (assuming it went well) ask the founder if they‚Äôd be open to introducing you to the fund.Why this works:- Can be done with 0 network- Investors appreciate intros from their portfolio companies more than anything else- Founders are almost always open to helping other founders- Since you‚Äôre in similar spaces, the founder may introduce you to other investorsWill this take a long time? Yes.Will this be more fruitful than cold emailing 300 investors? Also yes.You don‚Äôt need a huge network to get warm intros. You just need a system. Steal this system and secure meetings with high-potential investors ü§ùüèæ.Save and repost this for another founder!\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "We generated our first 100+ qualified leads from a single webinar with zero ad spend.If I were a first-time founder looking to build pipeline fast, here's exactly how I'd do it.Webinars are the most underutilized content tool for founders. We host 1-2 events a month, and they drive millions in pipeline for us.BEFORE THE WEBINAR1. Find a burning topic by searching LinkedIn for questions in your niche. Look for posts with high engagement but outdated answers.2. Identify the perfect host - someone who either works at a notable company OR has a strong following in your space. 3. Create a title that promises transformation, not information. \"From Intent to Impact: How to Get the Most Out of Your ERGs\" beats \"ERG Best Practices\" every time.4. Set up a form for people to register. Keep it short, but include these questions- Name- Email- Company name- Job title/department- Their #1 burning question about [topic]5. Use the questions from the registrations to compile a list of questions for your host. These will be 75% of your fireside chat.6. Create marketing materials for the event.7. Use the marketing materials from step 6 to publicize the webinar on your personal LinkedIn and to your company‚Äôs email list.8. Send the marketing materials from step 6 to your host. Encourage them to promote to their networks (they have influence and will attract potential customers)9. Send reminder emails to people who registered 1 week, 1 day, and 1 hour before the event.10. Test your tech setup 24 hours before. Nothing kills momentum like technical difficulties.AFTER THE WEBINAR (where the magic happens)11. Export your full registration list and attendance lists within 1 hour. Speed matters here.12. Segment your list into three buckets:- HOT: Attended + asked questions + fits your ICP (ideal customer profile) perfectly- WARM: Attended + fits your ICP- NURTURE: Registered but didn't attend + fits your ICP13. For your HOT and WARM leads, use AI to craft personalized emails. These should include:- The webinar recording- Their burning question from registration- The answer to the question (answer it yourself it it wasn‚Äôt directly addressed in the webinar)- Your desire to learn about their role and to share more about your product14. For NURTURE leads, simply send the webinar recording and their burning question + an answer ‚Üí focus on awareness for these folks, not getting a meeting.Check out the image below for a template you can use for this outreach.---Congratulations! You just got your first 100 leads, and they came to YOU!Since that first webinar in October 2021, we've run 60+ events and generated $3M+ in pipeline. No fancy tools. No big budget. Just this repeatable process.What's your biggest challenge with generating leads? Drop it in the comments and I'll help you figure out if webinars could work for you üëáüèæ\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

She‚Äôd built a solid product and was obsessed with features.But when I asked how she'd get both creators AND users on the platform, he went quiet.\"That's what the funding is for,\" he said.Wrong answer.She‚Äôll struggle to raise until she can walk into a room and say: \"We've cracked distribution. Here are our first 10 users, and here's our path to 1,000.\"That gap between where you are and where investors need you to be? That's your fundraising gap.And if you're a first-time founder without Stanford or YC on your resume, you can't raise with gaps.Here are the 5 fundraising gaps that kill pre-seed rounds:1. Founder perception gapThe stuff you can't change overnight - Stanford pedigree, ex-Google, second-time founder status. If you don't have it, the other gaps become dealbreakers.2. Team gapCan you actually build this? Do you have the expertise? One technical co-founder isn't enough if you're building deep tech.3. Traction gapNot just users - PAYING customers or serious daily/monthly active users. \"We'll monetize later\" doesn't work in 2025.4. Distribution gapA repeatable way to get customers that isn't paid ads. VCs need to see that you can grow without burning their cash on Meta ads.5. Market gapProving the market is both big AND growing. A big stagnant market is just as bad as a small one.The truth is, if you have founder perception working for you, VCs will ignore the other gaps.If you don't (like 99% of us), you need to close these gaps BEFORE you fundraise.The marketplace founder? She needs to spend the next 3 months figuring out distribution, getting her first users, and showing momentum. Then she can raise.Stop fundraising, hoping someone will eventually say yes. Figure out your gaps. Close them. Then raise money to pour fuel on what's already working.What's the biggest gap between where you are today and where you need to be to fundraise?Drop it below - I read every comment and will share specific strategies ü§ùüèæ",

Kula told me: \"60-70% of outreach goes straight to trash because it's not personalized or completely outside my scope.\"How to contact angels the right way:1. Research - Find out what the angel invests in, OR what her background is in so you can identify their thesis2. Personalize - Reference their background, portfolio, or recent content3. Share traction - Lead with milestones that get attention. Revenue, users, a strong team, etc.4. Keep it scannable - Bullet points > paragraphsSteal this template for your outreach:SUBJECT (This is only available if you aren‚Äôt connected to the person; if you are, put this at the top of your message):[Company] - [impressive traction point] - [round stage]BODY:Hi [name],I'm [your name], Founder of [company].

    "content": "A founder I worked with went from building the 'Salesforce for solopreneurs' to 'client management for fractionals.' Here‚Äôs how I helped her avoid the trap that 99% of first-time founders fall into: starting too broad.The mistake most founders make:First-time founders think they need to solve everything for everyone to maximize their customer base. This is backwards. When you try to sell to everyone, you end up selling to no one.You can only think about serving \"everyone\" once you're mature and need to scale. Until then, start small. Like comically small.Case study: Morgan Smith, founder of ElevoMorgan is a fractional HR consultant juggling multiple clients.Her problem: She's got too many tools.- Bill.com for invoicing- Toggle for time tracking- ClickUp for project management- + dozens moreHer idea: build the \"Salesforce for solopreneurs\" - an all-in-one platform handling everything solopreneurs need.This sounds good, but there‚Äôs one (big) problem.If you build a product for every use case for every customer, you'll do everything just okay.When it comes to building product, the rule of thumb is 10x better or don‚Äôt bother.Instead, start with ONE value prop for ONE type of customer that solves a very painful problem really well.I worked with Morgan to drill down to her personal biggest pain point: client management.Now, she‚Äôs pivoted to building elevo, a client management platform specifically for fractional talent.Here‚Äôs how to niche down like Morgan:1. List your customer types - Morgan had solopreneurs, fractionals, consultants, and contractors2. Pick the one you understand best - She IS a fractional consultant3. Identify their single biggest pain point - For fractionals, it's managing multiple client relationships4. Build that one thing really well - Client management that actually works for how fractionals operatePaypal started as a payments platform solely for eBay sellers.Slack started as a messaging platform for software developers.The biggest companies started way smaller than you might think.If you're a first-time founder, start small and nail a problem for one specific customer type. When it‚Äôs time to worry about scale, you‚Äôll know.If you're a founder who could use someone to bounce ideas off, I'm doing 1-on-1 calls through Hubble!Book time here: https://lnkd.in/enpkFQii\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "Last year, we tried to raise a $250k bridge round to keep the lights on.The results: 30 meetings. Zero interest.Here‚Äôs why raising while desperate is code red for first-time founders and what to do instead.There are three tell-tale signs that a founder is raising out of desperation:- You're pitching survival, not growth - e.g., ‚Äúwe just need a few more months to figure things out‚Äù (this was me)- Your runway is under 6 months, and it shows in your models.- You're pre-revenue, asking investors to fund your experiments instead of scaling what's already working.Investors don't want to save your company. They want to accelerate a rocket ship that's already taking off.When you're desperate, you have zero leverage.Without leverage, one of two things is going to happen:1. Investors will pass, or, maybe worse,2. Investors will give you money, but on terrible terms because they know you either take that money or the company diesIn our case, it was # 1. After 30 meetings, I made the call to stop fundraising and figure out something else.We tried a few options, but ultimately had to make the tough decision to reduce our team.Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did.If I were smart, I would have realized that no VC was going to invest in a potentially sinking ship. I could have taken the two months I spent fundraising and focused on:1. Asking customers to pre-pay in exchange for a discount so we could extend runway2. Finding loan options (like Invest Atlanta)3. Requesting deferred payments from vendorsA year later, we‚Äôre profitable and never have to raise again.But that time we spent raising while desperate was painful.The golden rule for first-time founders raising venture capital:Raise like üñïüèæ, not like üôèüèæ.If you‚Äôre telling investors why you NEED their money, you‚Äôve already lost.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "For my pre-seed, I created a list of 30 target VCs. I quickly learned I needed to 10x that. Here's why first-time founders should identify 300+ funds to raise their first $1M ‚¨áÔ∏èBuilding your investor pipeline isn't about finding a handful of \"perfect fit\" funds.It's about understanding the (pretty low) conversion rates at each stage of the funnel.When I raised our pre-seed for Chezie, for every 10 investors on our target list, I got a meeting with only 3 of them - a 30% target-to-meeting conversion rate.For every 30 meetings, I got just 1 check. That‚Äôs a 3% meeting-to-check conversion rate.Here are some benchmarks for a first-time founder to use:- 50% list-to-response rate - For every 10 outreach attempts, only 5 investors will respond at all- 40% response-to-meeting rate - Of those who respond, only 4 out of 10 will agree to take a meeting- 5% meeting-to-check rate - Of those who take meetings, only 1 in 20 will actually write a checkMost people you reach out to won't respond.Of those who do respond, most will turn you down.And of those who actually meet with you, only 5% will write a check.If you're a first-time founder without YC backing or previous exits, don‚Äôt plan on better conversion rates than this.Now, let's reverse-engineer what this means for a $1M round.On average, to raise $1M, you‚Äôll need to secure 3 checks. The typical structure:- 1 lead check: $750k- 1 strong follow-on: $150k- 1 smaller follow-on: $100kLastly, let‚Äôs work backwards to figure out how many funds you need to add to your list:1. At 5% meeting-to-check odds, each investment requires 20 meetings2. 3 investments √ó 20 meetings = 60 total meetings needed3. At 40% response-to-meeting rate, each meeting requires 2.5 responses4. 60 meetings √ó 2.5 responses = 150 responses needed5. At 50% list-to-response rate, you need 300 investors on your target listThis sounds harsh, but it‚Äôs better to go in with realistic expectations than get burnt out after rejection #30.Fundraising success is about two things: 1. persistence, and 2. strategy.Knowing how many investors to identify is your foundation.A rule of thumb for any first-time founder raising their first $1M: start with 300 funds and go from there.Save this post and share with a founder friend!P.S. - I detailed this process in my CREAM eBook.

This would be our first customer, and SSO is a reasonable request for an enterprise company.Instead of digging deeper, I immediately promised we could build it.6 weeks of back-and-forth. Weekly check-ins with their team. Constant updates on our progress building the integration.\"Great news! We have Okta SSO!\"Then crickets.A few weeks later, the customer got back to us to let us know they were going a different direction.After hundreds of sales conversations, I know one thing for sure:Products are bought, not sold.When customers really want your product, they find reasons to buy it. When they don't, they find excuses not to.Most \"if you build this, we'll sign\" requests are just polite ways to say no.90% of these customers won't sign anyway. The other 10% will sign and make your life miserable with endless feature requests.Whenever I talk to a customer who requests a feature, I ask one question:\"If we had [feature] today, would you sign the contract this week?\"If yes, find a path forward (add it as a customization in the contract, extend the term by a few months to factor in the build, etc.).If no, call it out and move on.Luckily for us, 70% of our customers now use that Okta integration. So it wasn't a total loss.But I learned to stop chasing customers who are looking for reasons to say no.Funny enough, I‚Äôm 3.5 years into building Chezie, and I still find myself biting on feature requests from potential customers.The difference is that I now ask the hard questions first.

Open a spreadsheet with the following columns: - Person I know - LinkedIn URL - VC Connections2. In column A, list my top 20 closest connections that work in tech, startups, or venture capital. These should be CLOSE connections. Like you‚Äôd buy them dinner type of close.3. Open LinkedIn4. For the names in column A (people you know), go to their profile and copy/paste their LinkedIn profile URL in column B5. Go to the first person you know‚Äôs LinkedIn page6. Click Connections7. Click All filters8. Scroll down to find the Keywords section9. In the Company field, enter ‚Äúventures‚Äù10. In the Title field, enter ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù11. Copy each of the names that appear into the VC Connections column of your spreadsheet12. Go back to Step 11 and enter ‚Äúprincipal‚Äù13. Repeat steps 11 and 12 for the following title keywords: partner, analyst, platform, associate14. Go back to step 10 and replace ‚Äúventures‚Äù with ‚Äúcapital‚Äù15. Repeat steps 11-14.16. Repeat step 15 with partners, equity, fund, investments17. Go back to step 5 and repeat the entire process (steps 6-16) for the next Person you Know in your spreadsheet18. Email each connection individually and ask which of their VC connections they‚Äôd be able/open to introducing you to (this is why you want to list only close connections in step 2)19. Clean up your spreadsheet to include ONLY people you can get introduced to from the People you Know20. For each VC connection you can get an introduction to, go to the fund‚Äôs website21. Check to see that the fund‚Äôs thesis (tech, healthcare, B2B SaaS, etc.), geography, and stage match your company22. Clean up your spreadsheet to include ONLY funds that match23. Email each Person you Know asking for an introduction to [VC connection‚Äôs name] at [VC connection‚Äôs fund]24. Watch as the introductions come through and you book your first 10 (or more) meetings.First-time founders should plan on 100 meetings to close a $1M round.It‚Äôs a numbers game.Follow this process to get your first 10.I share a few more tactical ways to get VC meetings in my free, 62-page CREAM Ebook.

    "content": "50+ VCs ignored our meeting requests. Then we changed one sentence and everything shifted, ultimately helping us close our $790k pre-seed. Here‚Äôs why your one-liner matters and how to write one that gets investors interested.Your one-liner is a single sentence that helps investors understand what you‚Äôre building and why it can be huge. Our original one-liner was just okay:\"Chezie helps companies manage their ERGs with an all-in-one solution for tracking members, events, and budget.\"When I used this in my forwardable email, the results were discouraging. A lot of ‚Äúno, thanks‚Äù or worst yet‚Ä¶ crickets.After some reflection, I realized it was missing two critical elements:1. The size of the opportunity2. Our path to capturing itSo I updated our one-liner pivoted to this:\"Chezie is poised to help 57,000+ companies around the world create better products, build more inclusive workplaces, and ultimately drive business results by reimagining what's possible with their most underutilized asset: employee resource groups.\"Big difference.Our meeting request success rate jumped from 10% to 40%.Your one-liner needs to do more than explain what you do. It MUST show the massive opportunity you're chasing.Here's a one-liner template I wish I had earlier:\"[Company name] helps [type of customer + market size] in [industry] achieve [2-3 desired outcomes] with [your solution].\"Quick example (for a fictional AI healthcare startup) to drive it home:‚ùå Bad: \"Our AI platform helps medical offices schedule patient appointments.\"‚úÖ Great: \"Our AI scheduling solution enables 230,000+ medical practices across the US to reduce no-shows by 70% and increase revenue by $200K annually by revolutionizing how they manage patient appointments.\"See the difference?One final tip: don‚Äôt put too much into it. Your only goal with your one-liner is to get an investor‚Äôs attention enough to make them take the next step (respond to your email, schedule a call, etc.).If you‚Äôre raising and struggling to get meetings, change your one-liner and watch how investors respond.To my fellow founders: What pitch pivots helped you secure investor meetings?

    "content": "We doubled ARR last year while actually shrinking our team.Here's how we built playbooks that run a 6-figure ARR startup with just 2 people ‚¨áÔ∏èI was spending 1-3 hours a week on QA because \"only I knew how to do it right.\" The same applies to customer onboarding, support, and product updates. You get the point. It turns out that I wasn't protecting quality. I was slowing down growth.The solution? Playbooks (otherwise known as SOPs)Instead of hiring more people, we built playbooks for every process. These aren‚Äôt manuals; they're step-by-step guides that let anyone (contractors, team members, even our admin) handle tasks that used to require Dumebi Egbuna's or my time.Here‚Äôs the 10-step process I use to build our playbooks:1. Identify your tech stack - Notion for storage, Figma for diagrams2. Outline your playbook - 20% of the playbook should answer who and why. The remaining 80% is how the process is done3. Use AI to find gaps - upload your outline to ChatGPT and ask it to identify gaps in your playbook4. Update your outline - Incorporate the AI feedback5. Generate interview questions - Let AI act as an expert in whatever process you‚Äôre documenting. Ask it for interview questions6. Respond to questions - Respond to the questions (I use Wispr Flow) with detailed answers7. Draft first version - Have AI write it section by section8. Refine until comprehensive - Fine-tune each section until you‚Äôre happy with it9. Add visual elements - Optional, but these make complex processes clear10. Share with your team - Share with your team to read asynchronously and then debrief on a callThe ROI is insane.Building our QA playbook took ~12 hours. Two weeks in, and I‚Äôve already gotten that time back. If you zoom out, I anticipate getting 50+ hours back.Now our admin handles most of the QA, I focus on high-value work, and our quality has improved because she approaches testing like a real user would.You can't scale by doing everything yourself. Eventually, founders must release the reins and start building systems, not dependencies.Good processes don't slow you down; they free you up.We review our playbooks every six months to keep them current. The investment in time upfront pays off BIG down the road.Be honest, what process are you hoarding that could be turned into a playbook?

You'll lose track of who you've talked to, forget to follow up with interested investors, and miss opportunities because you can't stay organized.A proper CRM helps you stick to a process and ensures sure nothing falls through the cracks.Start by opening a spreadsheet. I use Notion since you can relate columns to other databases, but Google Sheets or Airtable would also work. Next, add the following columns:1. Name of fund 2. Investor contact - list 2-3 people from the fund who make investment decisions3. Fund website URL4. Funding stage - pre-seed, seed, etc.5. Location - don‚Äôt pitch people who only invest in Europe if you‚Äôre in ATL6. Industry focus - don't pitch healthcare VCs your fintech startup7. Check size - know if they write $25k or $1M checks, so you know the value of your pipeline8. Who can intro? - *MOST IMPORTANT* map who you know that can introduce you to someone at the fundYou can get creative with this! I added columns for the fund‚Äôs portfolio page and a column for the fund‚Äôs application link (if it was available).Now, all you need to do is fill it out.Go through Crunchbase and public investor databases to add funds to this list. Your target should be 300 funds.Fundraising is a numbers game with a 95%+ rejection rate. Without proper tracking, you'll lose deals in the chaos, and with a conversion rate that‚Äôs already so low, founders can‚Äôt afford to let anything slip through the cracks.I break down the entire process‚Äîincluding my exact CRM template‚Äîin my free CREAM ebook.Click \"Visit my store\" at the top of this post to download it ü§ùüèæWhat columns would you add?

They just don't talk about it because it's too painful.It's okay to prioritize paying yourself. You have options beyond the \"suffer for your startup\" narrative:TRADITIONAL PATHSThese are fine, but they could easily lead to burnout, which damages the company's health.‚Ä¢ Live off savings‚Ä¢ Raise VCUNCONVENTIONAL PATHSThese are *also* fine, but they might pull you away from your startup and slow progress:‚Ä¢ Get customers to pre-pay (tough but doable)‚Ä¢ Work a side gig while you build (even teaching fitness classes helps)‚Ä¢ Build nights and weekends while keeping your day job‚Ä¢ Apply for grantsChoose the path that works for you, but understand that you can't build effectively when you're stressed about making rent.The most valuable asset of your company is you.As a founder, you have to take care of yourself in a way that sustains your drive and focus to work on your company. If that means you need to pay yourself upfront, then do that.The solution isn't always \"raise more money\" or \"live like you're broke.\" There are 10,000 different ways to build your company.

Share your pitch deck with the investor as early as possible.2. Read the fund‚Äôs website. Look for check size, stage, and past investments3. Research the investor to find overlap: alma mater, mutual connections, hometown ‚Äî something personal4. Write down a 60-second version of your pitch that covers the problem, solution, market size, and your ask (how much you‚Äôre raising)5. Go to ChatGPT and upload your pitch deck. Ask it to act as a seasoned VC with 20 years experience and draft a list of questions about your company6. Copy that list of questions and write responses to each in a document7. (Optional) Send the responses to ChatGPT for one round of follow-up questions to cover any gaps you might have missed8. Join the call 2‚Äì3 minutes early and set up a split screen with your video on one side and the document from step 6 on the otherDURING THE MEETING1. Start with small talk (2‚Äì3 mins), and try to loop in anything you found in step 32. IMPORTANT: Ask the investor ‚ÄúI shared the deck ahead of this call; would you rather I go through the deck, or do you prefer just to ask questions?‚ÄùThis helps you: 1. know if the investor has read your deck ahead of the meeting (showing genuine interest), and 2. demonstrate confidence.3. If they say deck, walk through it in under 10 minutes4. If they say questions, start with your 60-second elevator pitch and then open the convo for their questions5. During the conversation, refer to the document you made in step 6 if you need to6. With 3-5 minutes left, ask the investor questions. Three simple questions to ask:- ‚ÄúDo you typically lead rounds?‚Äù- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your check size and typical process?‚Äù- ‚ÄúWhat would you need to see to be excited about leading this?‚Äù7. Confirm next steps before ending the call. Ask when you should follow up.AFTER THE MEETING1. Send a follow-up email within 1 hour (ideally, you have this drafted already) that includes a thank you, data room link, and any additional details you said you would share2. Update your investor CRM3. Set a calendar reminder to follow up in 3‚Äì5 days if you haven‚Äôt heard back4. Repeat at step 1 for the next meetingCongratulations!

Most second-time founders have never had an exit. And the majority of us didn‚Äôt go to Stanford or work at Google.99% of founders fall into groups 4 and 5.If you‚Äôre in the 99% (like me), then you‚Äôre an average founder in VC terms.And because you‚Äôre an average founder, you can‚Äôt expect the same outcomes as an ‚Äúabove-average‚Äù founder:- You probably won‚Äôt be able to close a round in 2 weeks- You probably won‚Äôt be able to raise money pre-revenue- You probably won‚Äôt be able to hire the ‚Äúbest‚Äù talent (like the early Uber engineer who needs a $300k salary)There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being an average founder if you know the game you‚Äôre playing.Instead of trying to do what the Group 1-3 founders do, try:- Creating a PROCESS for your fundraise- Getting paying customers to validate your idea THEN going after VC- Hiring fractional or contract talent instead of full-time employees to keep costs lowAll of the traditional startup advice was built for the ‚Äúabove-average‚Äù founder.If you‚Äôre in the 99%, stop following their playbook and start building yours.Your time will come, but it starts with winning the game you‚Äôre in today.What‚Äôs one piece of traditional startup advice you‚Äôve stopped following?

    "content": "You've sent 200 cold emails and gotten 3 VC meetings.You've had 30 first meetings and zero second meetings.You can still raise, but you first need to get strategic about what you fix.Fundraising has a funnel, just like sales.First-time founders should think of that funnel in three stages:1. Top of funnel - getting the meeting2. Middle of funnel - going from first meeting ‚Üí due diligence3. Bottom of funnel - close (i.e., getting a check)When I raised for Chezie, I had challenges at each stage. Here's how to debug your fundraising process:TOP OF FUNNEL: Getting the meetingCommon challenges:- You send hundreds of cold emails but can‚Äôt get investor meetingsWhat's probably happening:‚Üí You aren‚Äôt prioritizing warm intros‚Üí You aren‚Äôt describing your company in a way that shows market size or urgency‚Üí You're targeting the wrong investors (wrong stage/sector)What to do instead:‚Üí Stop cold emailing; always try for a warm intro first. If you don‚Äôt have a direct contact, ask a friend of a friend.‚Üí Only contact investors that invest in AT LEAST two of the following: your geography, your industry, or your stageMIDDLE OF FUNNEL: Progressing to Due DiligenceCommon challenge:- Lots of first meetings, no second meetingsWhat's probably happening:‚Üí You're not getting investors excited enoughWhat to do instead:- Focus on the big vision; tell the investor what the world looks like if you‚Äôre successful.- Find ways to demonstrate that you‚Äôre building what COULD be a billion-dollar business- Ask directly: \"Do you want to learn more, or are you passing?‚ÄùBonus pro tip: Never send more than two follow-ups to VCs. If they don‚Äôt respond after the second, it‚Äôs a pass. Keep it pushing.BOTTOM OF FUNNEL: CloseCommon challenges:- Investors seem interested but won't commit (e.g., \"We like it but want to see more traction\")- The process drags on for weeks without a firm ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚ÄôWhat's probably happening:‚Üí There‚Äôs no lead investor to create momentum‚Üí You haven't built urgency around the roundWhat to do instead:- If possible, get at least one check before you formally start raising (even if it‚Äôs from friends and family or an accelerator). This builds urgency.- Give investors a reasonable deadline for a decisionBonus protip 2: If the investor passes, ask for reasons. Usually, at this stage in the funnel, they will share feedback that you can use to improve your pitch for future investors.- - -Each stage of your fundraising funnel tells you exactly what to fix, but 95% of founders try to brute force it by simply sending more emails.Your fundraising challenges aren't random. They're predictable (and fixable).Which stage is giving you the most trouble? Drop it in the comments and I'll help you debug it ü§ùüèæ",

    "content": "97% of founders get nervous when investors ask about their competition. I see it as an opportunity.Here's how to talk about your competition in a way that actually helps you close the round üëáüèæWhen VCs ask, \"Who are your competitors?\" too many founders default to defensive positioning rather than using the question to get investors excited about their company AND the market they're in.Founders usually address competition in one of two ways:1. The 2x2 matrix with your company magically positioned in the top right2. The feature comparison table where you check every box, and competitors don'tEither way, the goal of this slide is to say \"our product is 10x better than our competition, so we aren‚Äôt worried about them.‚Äù(If your pitch deck looks like this, don‚Äôt feel bad; mine did too)How founders SHOULD talk about competition:Instead of just explaining why you're better, use competition to:1. Validate market size and investor hype around the space 2. Establish benchmarks for growth and valuation3. Showcase your competitive advantages to the bigger playersDon‚Äôt bash competition; use their success to bolster your case.Real-world case study: Regimen AII recently worked with Rey Mendoza from Regimen AI to help him plan for his upcoming raise. His main competitors are Kajabi and BetterUp.The old way Rey might position against competitors:\"Kajabi and BetterUp aren't AI-first. Our platform gives creators more control and better tools.\"The new way that gets investors excited:\"Kajabi reached $100M ARR in 5 years with 56,000 subscribers, while BetterUp hit similar revenue in 8 years and raised at a $4.7B valuation. They've proven this market is massive and venture-backable.But both were built pre-AI revolution. Our AI-first approach and focus on creator autonomy positions us to not only capture new market share, but also potentially convert their customers who want more advanced capabilities.\"See the difference? The second approach:- Uses competitor metrics to validate market potential- Establishes concrete benchmarks for your own growth trajectory- Shows you understand the competitive landscape AND have identified a legitimate openingWhen VCs ask about competition, they're really asking:1. Do you understand your market?2. Can you articulate your unique advantage?3. Do you have realistic growth expectations?Every investor question is an opportunity. Don't just defend against competition - use it to prove your thoughtfulness and strengthen your case.Steal the template in the slide design below (made in Pitch) and update your competition slide to make it an asset ü§ùüèæWhat's your approach to discussing competitors in investor pitches?h/t Tony E.

Raise VC and pour fuel on the fire.But if you're still struggling with go-to-market, sales, product, etc. (which is 100% okay), take the time to figure that out first.Stop thinking venture capital will save you.Work with constraints.

Meanwhile, I watch pre-seed companies with 15+ people and Series A startups employing 25+, wondering what they're thinking ü§îStartup culture encourages founders to celebrate having big teams. Founders treat new hires like funding announcements‚Äîthey broadcast them for everyone to see how ‚Äòwell‚Äô they‚Äôre doing.But in reality, only two metrics truly count: happy customers and revenue.The best approach to recruiting is simple: hire when it hurts. That means:- The founding team is regularly pulling 12+ hour days- Your team shows clear signs of exhaustion and productivity declines as a result- Your company starts to miss things that previously weren‚Äôt a problem (support tickets, sales follow-ups, etc.)Even if it hurts, hiring should be your last resort. Before looking to grow your team, consider:- Looking for freelancers and part-time specialists- Implementing software tools ($200/month is far cheaper than $100k/year for a new hire)- Incorporating AI and automation like @zapier to multiply your current team‚Äôs productivityYour only goal as a founder is to stay alive, and you do that by minimizing costs.The simplest way to minimize costs is to hire thoughtfully and intentionally.Celebrate staying in business over expanding your team.How do you think about startup hiring?

    "content": "I bombed my first 15 VC pitches because investors were reading my slides instead of listening to me. Here‚Äôs why you need TWO versions of your pitch deck and how to craft each üëáüèæIf you‚Äôre fundraising, you should have two decks: 1. A shared deck2. A presentation deck The difference between them is subtle but huge if you want to raise VC.1Ô∏è‚É£ A shared deck - to be sent via email as you ask for introductions to investors, or send cold emails.- Use complete headlines that summarize key points- Include sufficient context so it makes sense without you- Make it skimmable with bold text highlighting key metrics- Includes citations/sources2Ô∏è‚É£ A presentation deck - to be displayed during pitches to GUIDE your pitch, not do the presenting for you. - Limit text to 10 words per slide maximum- Use large, impactful numbers (57,000 companies!)- Rely on visuals, graphics, and icons to tell the story- Keep slides simple - YOU are the presentation, not the deckWhen I switched to this dual approach, it was easier to engage investors. They asked better questions.My pitches became conversations instead of my clicking to the next slide for the investor. The worst thing that can happen during a pitch is for you to share a great story or point about your traction, but the investor isn‚Äôt paying attention because they‚Äôre too busy reading the essay that you put on your slides. What questions do you have about your deck? Share them below!\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "\"We don't have any competition. What we‚Äôre building is completely unique.\"Stop me if you‚Äôve heard this before. Or better yet, stop me if you‚Äôve said this yourself.Every startup has competition. Here‚Äôs how to think about it as a founder.When building Chezie, we looked at two different types of competitors:1. Other companies2. The status quo- - -The first type of competition is what most founders think of: other companies with a similar product.For us, that was other community and people experience platforms. Sure, what we envisioned for Chezie was different from what was already out there. If it weren‚Äôt, we wouldn‚Äôt have started the company.However, it would have been naive to think that just because none of them were building EXACTLY what we were building, we didn‚Äôt have competition. The mistake most founders make here is thinking that they don‚Äôt need to think about competition because their product offers something new. Don‚Äôt be one of those founders. Consider your competition and what sets you apart. This is your unique value; it‚Äôs things like your pricing, available integrations, or your interface. - - -The second kind of competition is what first-time founders often overlook. It‚Äôs how your customers are ALREADY solving the problem you‚Äôre working on. In our case, our customers were using a disjointed system to manage their communities:Slack, spreadsheets, distro lists, you name it. In 99% of our early sales calls, we had to explain why Chezie was a better solution than the status quo, not why we were better than other platforms.We sold them on the amount of time they lost using those systems, and more importantly, the opportunity cost of *not* using a dedicated solution for their groups: Missing data about impact, a poor member experience, and an inability to expand the program and secure more budget.Unless there‚Äôs already a huge player in your space (for example, if you‚Äôre creating a better version of Slack), the status quo is what you should focus 90% of your time on. The founders who win aren't the ones who ignore competition‚Äîthey're the ones who understand it, respect it, and then build something better anyway.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "An investor wasted 3 months of a founder's time before revealing he had no money to invest. Believe it or not, VCs are incentivized to operate this way. If you're a first-time founder raising VC, here are 3 questions you should ask every investor to determine their seriousness üëáüèæ1. Are you actively investing?The investor might be closing his fund or between funds I and II. In either case, asking this gets straight to the point. Either way, if they aren‚Äôt actively writing checks, thank them for their time and move on to the next investor. 2. What's your decision-making process and timeline? Every investor should have a process for making decisions. Even solo GPs have LPs to report to. If she can‚Äôt clearly answer how she makes investment decisions or how long that process takes, keep it moving. 3. What percentage of your current fund have you already allocated? Like #1, this helps you understand if the investor is actively cutting checks, but it goes deeper.If the investor has a $20M fund and only 10% is allocated, they have plenty of money to work with and might be less judicious with how they spend it. Alternatively, a VC who has allocated 85% of their fund might still be actively investing but could be super stringent or have limited capacity for follow-on investments.- - -Raising money is a two-way street. While you're asking for money, you're also interviewing the investor.ALWAYS take 3-5 minutes in your VC calls to ask the investor questions and gauge their seriousness about your company. Your time is your most valuable asset as a founder. Don‚Äôt waste it on an investor who never planned to write you a check.Founders, what other questions do you ask to qualify VCs?

    "content": "When I raised my pre-seed, I spent 2 months focusing on points that didn't matter. We closed the round when I realized I only needed to focus on two things:1. Proving that you have a path to a big vision2. Proving that the money is the only thing between you today and you getting to the next milestone on that pathThat's it.VCs want to know that they are funding something huge. Something that will change the way a large number of people do something (business teams, consumers, etc).They also want to know that if they give you $1M, you're going to multiply that. That $1M will turn into $2M in revenue, a redesigned product, or a new GTM motion to get your next 100 customers.When raising for Chezie, I focused on what I THOUGHT was important:- Product- Team- Market opportunity+ Competition, business model, blah blah blahWhile this is important, none of this matters if you can't pitch your vision and next milestone.The product, market size, competition, team, etc. are all just complementary to your vision and next milestone.- If you nail the complementary stuff but miss on vision and milestone, you won't raise.- If you nail the vision and milestone, but you suck at pitching the complementary stuff, you'll successfully raise VC.- If you nail the vision, milestone, AND complementary stuff, you'll raise quickly and abundantly.It's that simple.So next time you're building your pitch deck, start with these two questions:1. \"What world-changing vision am I building toward?\"2. \"What specific milestone will this money help me achieve?\"Nail those, and you've already won 90% of the battle. Everything else is just supporting evidence.Don't overcomplicate it.Are you raising VC for the first time? Comment or connect + DM me any questions you have!

    "content": "Time kills fundraising deals. A founder lost $500k by taking one week to create a financial model. I avoided this with my 3-step process üëáüèæWhen raising VC, momentum is everything. The founder who lost out on that $500k check was asked for a financial model. Because they didn‚Äôt properly prepare, they had to take a week to make it from scratch. By the time they sent it over, the investor had moved on.Avoid this mistake by breaking your raise into three steps: pre-fundraising, fundraising, and maintaining. PRE-FUNDRAISING (6+ months before):People think fundraising is all about non-step investor meetings. They ignore the prep work.During this stage, you should:- Build your target investor list and connect the dots for warm intro requests- Prepare ALL docs (pitch deck, financial model, market calculations)- Draft email templates (forwardable emails, follow-ups)FUNDRAISING (2-3 months):In this phase, you‚Äôre:- Taking 4-5 investor meetings a day- Pitching and tweaking your deck weekly- Following up with investors (up to 3 times, then move on)- Responding to requests from investors in due diligence- Closing the roundIf you've done pre-fundraising right, you spend 100% of your energy on meetings and relationship-building, not scrambling to create documents.MAINTENANCE (ongoing):Traditional advice tells you always to be raising, but that‚Äôs wrong. Maintain relationships with investors with a system:- Send monthly investor updates- Schedule quarterly check-ins with high-priority investorsCan you raise VC without this process? Of course!Can you raise VC without ANY process? Probably not. Before you raise venture capital, create a plan. Once you have a plan, see it through until the money is in the bank üí∞.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

But here‚Äôs what happened behind the scenes building Chezie:- 100+ VCs told us no- Built and laid off our team. Twice.- Got sued by a DEI consultant.- Lost customers during the DEI pullback.- Repositioned. Signed some new customers.- Questioned everything. Bought back in. Questioned everything again.Not exactly the journey my immigrant parents imagined when they brought us to the U.S. in 1997. But that‚Äôs the beauty of being a founder. The hardest days teach you the most, and the low points make you appreciate the wins that much more.And I wouldn't trade this journey for anything. I learned more in the first 12 months as a founder than in my 5 years consulting.If you're thinking about starting something, I can promise two things:1.

    "content": "The best fundraising advice I ever received came from a founder who's raised $353M:Raise on traction or vision, but never both.In a brief interaction with Christina Cacioppo of Vanta, she shared this nugget with me. VCs want to invest in businesses that can be MASSIVE. Your job as a founder is to prove that you're building something that can reach that scale.If you're early-stage, you might be able to prove it with your traction, but it's unlikely.For Chezie, raising on traction was leading with something like this:\"We've grown to $100k ARR in 6 months with 5 enterprise customers.\"We thought that this traction would be more than enough for VCs to invest, but there was one problem:We couldn't tell how this grows to $100M in ARR.Sure, $100k is impressive.But VCs don't invest for $100k. Or $1M. Or even $10M.Every VC must believe that what you're building can grow to $100M ARR.If they don't believe that, there's nothing you can say to get their buy-in. It doesn't matter how much traction you have, how great your product is, or how impressive your team is.It's $100M or pass.So, after 25-ish meetings, we pivoted to raising on vision:\"We want to help enterprises connect their most under-utilized asset (employee resource groups) to their business goals, like building a product or generating sales.‚ÄùBoom.That's a vision-first story that a venture capitalist can get excited about.And it worked. When we switched from pitching traction to pitching vision, our meetings changed completely. Investors leaned in, and the right questions were asked. And finally, the checks ($800k worth) started coming in.Traction sells the present, but vision sells the future. And VCs are in the business of betting on futures.So, if you're a first-time founder struggling to raise money, ask yourself this: Am I trying to sell both traction and vision? Choose one lane (probably your vision) and go all in. Your bank account will thank you.What‚Äôs the best fundraising advice you ever got? Share in the comments üëáüèæ",

    "content": "I wasted $250k because I assumed I'd raise VC to save me.That lost money has led me to one crucial understanding:The best thing early-stage founders can do is build as if VC doesn't exist.The VC-backed startup model follows a predictable pattern:1. Founders build massive teams before they're needed2. Companies raise more money than necessary3. Products are priced beyond their actual value4. Large amounts are wasted on paid ads and PR campaignsAs I built Chezie the assumption that I would need to raise VC led to some bad decision-making with hiring an expensive engineering team too soon, migrating from our low-code tech stack too early, and quitting my full-time job too quickly.The result? $250k in money that I wish I had back.But imagine a different approach:- Instead of quitting your job with no traction, work part-time on your idea until it generates enough revenue to support you.- Instead of building a large team right away, you hire contractors or part-time employees until full-time staff becomes absolutely necessary.- Instead of pricing your product to grow into your valuation, you price your products based on the actual value they provide, which also builds trust and loyalty with your customers.I am not anti-VC or against the traditional startup playbook. It works great for startups in super-competitive markets or capital-intensive industries like hardware.But 95% of founders would be better off building sustainable software businesses that don't follow this playbook.It's time to think beyond the old startup playbook‚Äîthere are many ways to win.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "I needed to pitch 300 investors to close our $780k pre-seed round. Most founders quit after 30.Here is how to calculate the number of funds you need to identify before you raise VC. ‚¨áÔ∏èYour investor pipeline is a list of funds and angel investors you want to invest in your round. Think of it as a funnel (with some rough conversion rates).For every 10 investors on our target list, I got a meeting with only 3 of them - a 30% target-to-meeting conversion rate.For every 30 meetings, I got just 1 check. That‚Äôs a 3% meeting-to-check conversion rate.Unless you're YC-backed or a founder with a proven track record, I wouldn't plan on a target-to-meeting conversion rate higher than 50% or a meeting-to-check conversion rate higher than 10%.Knowing this, you need to work backward to figure out how many investors you need on your list. For a typical $2M round, that looks like:- 1 lead investor for $1M- 1 follow-on investor for $500k- 1 follow-on investor for $300k- $200k in smaller checks from angels and friends/familyThat's 3 institutional checks to form your round. What does that mean in practice?- With a 5% meeting-to-check conversion rate, you need 20 meetings for each check- 3 checks √ó 20 meetings = 60 total investor meetings needed- With a 40% outreach-to-meeting success rate, each meeting requires 2.5 outreach attempts- 60 meetings √ó 2.5 outreach attempts = 150 investors on your target listAnd for underrepresented founders facing bias, double these numbers.This isn't meant to discourage you as a founder; it's meant to give you perspective and get your mind right before you start raising.Anyone can raise money if they're persistent and strategic about it. Understanding how many investors you need to identify is the first step in that journey.--P.S. - I write about this in detail in my free CREAM ebook on how to raise VC.

If you were a founder who got rejected from YC yesterday, here's what you should do next: 1. Figure out your go-to-marketEveryone loves to jump into building products. But that‚Äôs the easy (ish) part. What‚Äôs hard is figuring out how to get your product in front of customers. With Chezie we realized that live webinars drove 300-400 leads to our top of funnel every time we hosted one, so we doubled down on them.The result: 60% of our pipeline came inbound. This was huge for getting us from $100-500k ARR.2. Get 5 customers who LOVE your productYou‚Äôd rather have 5 customers who love your product than 25 who are lukewarm. Lukewarm = indifference.Indifference means that the customer won‚Äôt hesitate to stop using your product if and WHEN times get hard. We learned that the hard way and churned some of our early customers who weren‚Äôt the best fits. 3. Decide if you want to re-applyYC is the Harvard of startup accelerators. That‚Äôs not up for debate. However, there are ways to get 90% of the benefits without giving up 15% of your company. - Check out YC‚Äôs startup school for lessons on building a startup. - Raise money from friends and family for way less equity. - Join an equity-free incubator to build relationships with other founders.Will the above experience be the same as YC? Of course not.But ask yourself: is that extra 10% worth 15% of your company? Getting rejected from YC is an inevitability for 99% of startup founders. If you just got denied, use it as fuel. Time to build üöÄIf you've been denied from YC before, how'd you respond?\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

Investors know it.But the biggest mistake I made when raising for Chezie was treating investors like ATMs - only contacting them when I needed capital. Our fundraise took much longer than it should have because we started from zero relationships.If I could do it all over again (or if I was planning to raise again this year), I'd start networking with VCs now - not when I needed the money.

We spent months analyzing \"competitors\" in the community software space and preparing sales arguments for why we were better.But our real competition turned out to be something totally different.Spreadsheets. Slack channels. Google Drive.Companies have managed their ERGs this way for years.It's messy and wildly inefficient, but it's familiar. And familiarity is a powerful force.Today, when we pitch to customers, we rarely mention other software platforms.Instead, we focus on why it's worth changing their existing processes.We talk about the hidden costs of their current approach, the time and cost savings the customer will see, and the data they‚Äôre missing out on with their disconnected tools.In most cases, founders are competing with a set of existing, one-size-fits-all tools like spreadsheets and Google Docs.When you understand this, you approach everything differently:1. Your sales strategy becomes about change management, not feature comparison.2. Your marketing focuses on the pain of the status quo, not other solutions.3. Your customer success becomes about proving that the change was worth it.So founders, as you build your companies, remember:Don't just ask \"Why are we better than Competitor X?\"Ask \"Why should someone change how they've always done things?\"Answer that question well, and you'll overcome your biggest competition.What status quo is your product fighting against?\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

They're looking for reasons to say no, and they have dozens of meetings every week with founders who all believe their company is the next unicorn.Your job in that first meeting is simply to:- Address enough objections to keep them curious- Demonstrate you understand your market- Show you have the right team to execute- Leave them wanting to learn moreEven the fastest deals typically take 2-3 meetings before a term sheet, and that's lightning speed in the VC world.So, instead of trying to get a check in one meeting, focus on being impressive enough to make them want to continue the conversation.

It's about building the company YOU want to develop.The problem isn't venture capital.The problem is how VC has warped founders' mindsets about building companies.You don't have to raise multiple rounds, hire a huge team, and chase a billion-dollar valuation.

Here‚Äôs why and how to approach building instead üëáüèæThe founder who raised $2M operated with the assumption that he could raise more money even if his first attempt went nowhere. The quicker he spent the money, the quicker he could validate if his idea was venture scalable. Most underrepresented founders understand that we‚Äôre fortunate to raise even half of that amount. Therefore, we‚Äôre best off operating as if the money we've secured might be the last funding we'll ever get.This doesn‚Äôt mean that we don‚Äôt experiment or hoard every penny. But it does mean rethinking the idea of failing fast. Instead of \"failing fast,\" I believe founders need to \"learn fast.‚Äù1. Experiment with the minimum viable version of something2. See if it works before investing more3. If it doesn't work, understand why and pivot quicklyThis applies to everything:- Considering a UX designer? Hire a contractor before committing to full-time- Building a new product feature? Prototype it with no-code tools (I‚Äôve loved using Vercel v0 lately) and get customers to pre-buy before allocating three months of dev resourcesRemember that just because you aren't failing fast doesn't mean you aren't moving fast. Startups always need to move quickly. But \"failing fast\" under the assumption there's always more money to carry you through? That's a privilege most founders simply don't have.The better approach: Learn fast. Test quickly. Conserve resources. Build sustainably.What do you think? Is \"fail fast\" realistic advice for most founders? Share in the comments!",

Here‚Äôs how I reworked my strategy to close my $790k pre-seed üëáüèæInvestors get (literally) hundreds of cold emails from founders every day. Many won‚Äôt even take a meeting with a founder unless someone they know introduces them.Instead of cold emailing investors, send your cold emails to people who can connect you to those investors. Two reasons why this works:1. Connectors get far fewer cold emails than investors, so they're more likely actually to open and read what you send2. They're often happy to help founders (especially if they've been in your shoes)Focus on finding people at least one degree of separation away from you (use LinkedIn's connection feature to check), and send them a thoughtful message asking for an introduction. Here‚Äôs a template you can use: SUBJECT: Quick question about connecting with [VC Partner]BODY:Hi [Connector's first name],I noticed your connection to [VC Partner/Firm] and wanted to reach out. I'm building [Company] [one-line description with traction point].We're raising our [round] and I believe [VC Partner] would be a great fit because [specific reason tied to their investment thesis/portfolio].Would you be open to making an introduction? I can send over a forwardable email to make it easy.Thanks for considering,TobyThis approach helped us secure over 50 investor meetings during our raise.The best advice I never got: Stop cold emailing investors. Start cold emailing the people who know them.What's been your experience with getting intros vs. cold emails? Drop it in the comments!",

Many founders are forced to take down rounds or unfavorable terms because they need capital.At Chezie, we have two paths in front of us:1. Raise more capital to grow the team and move faster2. Stay lean and grow steadily with our current resourcesBecause we're profitable, we can choose option two and wait for better market conditions (or never raise again). Many founders don't have this choice.That's optionality.When founders don‚Äôt have optionality, bad things happen. - They raise money from VCs on terrible terms or even on down rounds, diluting themselves and their employees- They build every feature that every customer asks for instead of focusing on one ICP. Those customers ultimately churn, leaving the founders with a bloated product that no one wants.- They do a fire sale to get the company acquired because the only other option is to go out of businessWithout optionality, you make desperate decisions.With optionality, choices open up.You can raise more money.Or stay independent.Or focus on profitability.Your company, your choice.",

    "content": "We were 90 days from running out of money before it finally hit me:My ego was stopping me from doing what was best for the company. Founder ego kills more startups than anything else. Here‚Äôs why and how founders can work around it.Great founders walk the line between confident and arrogant. You don‚Äôt start a company without much self-belief.But that confidence can easily lead to ego-driven decisions. A few examples:1. Instead of directly asking a customer to pay for what you‚Äôre building, you jump straight into building the product because you‚Äôre so confident that you know what the customer needs. Then, when you try to sell it, you realize you‚Äôve wasted time and money building something no one wants. 2. Instead of sending monthly updates and keeping your investors in the loop, you hide bad news and only come to them when it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it.3. Instead of being realistic about needing to shut down the company, you keep pushing because you think you‚Äôre just one breakthrough away from turning things around.I can say all of this because I‚Äôve had to come to terms with these things while building Chezie. We had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars building a new version of our product that clearly wasn‚Äôt working. Deep down, I knew this months before, but I kept pushing because we‚Äôd already invested so much into the new build. Fast forward a few months, and I‚Äôm staring at less than 3 months' runway in our bank account. Only then did I do what I should‚Äôve done well beforehand: I pulled the plug on the new build, scaled our team down, and cut our costs by 40%. Today, we‚Äôre profitable and growing, but we almost didn‚Äôt get here because my ego got in the way.As a founder, your self-belief is often the thing that got you to where you are. However, it‚Äôs important not to let that cloud your decision-making. If you‚Äôre ever scared to do something because you‚Äôll feel embarrassed or worried about how people will look at you, you‚Äôre putting your ego in front of what‚Äôs best for your company.The best founders know when to put their egos aside and listen.Do you?",

Here‚Äôs what that means for VCs and how that will have huge benefits for founders over the next 5-10 years üëáüèæIn the past, venture capitalists used their dollars to help their portfolio companies create technical moats. While some founders had success building big, VC-scale businesses, many over-funded and over-valued companies flamed out, leaving the founders and investors with nothing.But something interesting is happening in 2025.AI is making it possible to build AND scale with less capital than ever. This means founders can finally choose a different path:1. Raise enough to build comfortably ($300-500K) - no more living on ramen2. Keep 80%+ ownership by raising just one round3. Focus on sustainable, profitable growth4. Target a life-changing $10-$100M exit where everyone winsThis isn't just theory.More investors (like Tony E. Kula) are actively seeking founders who want to build real, profitable businesses instead of chasing unicorn status.They're looking for:- Deep domain expertise over flashy credentials- Capital efficiency over burning cash- Profitability and sustainable growth over growth at all costsDo you know who‚Äôs been forced to develop these traits for YEARS?Underrepresented founders.AI has leveled the playing field. We can finally build companies OUR way - by securing just enough funding to pay ourselves decent salaries in the early days, maintaining majority ownership, and keeping the door open to exits that change our lives, even if they‚Äôre under the $1B mark.The question isn't whether you can build a unicorn.The question is: are you sure that you want to?",

    "content": "I‚Äôve secured over $1.2M in funding for my company. But the path has not been what you‚Äôd expect.After 3 years of building Chezie, here's our actual fundraising journey:- $20K of our own savings- $275K from grants- $160K from friends/family- $110K from pitch competitions- $100K from accelerators- $470K from VCs- $25K from revenue-based financingTwo things most founders miss:1. Revenue unlocks everything Without paying customers, we wouldn't have qualified for grants, VC, or loans.  Focus on revenue first and all of the other funding options become available to you.  2. Don't limit your options Only about a third of our funding came from VCs. Another third was completely equity-free.  Be open to whatever funding source you can get to reach your goals. The reality is that there's no 'right way' to fund your startup.Whether working your day job longer, consulting to get some early revenue, taking loans, or raising from friends and family, do whatever works. The best funding source is the one that keeps your company alive.And sometimes that means taking the path others won't. Build your company your way.What untraditional funding paths have you taken to grow your startup? Share them in the comments! üëáüèæ",

    "content": "Pet peeve: when people say fundraising is just like sales. Fundraising is not sales because it runs on FOMO. Here‚Äôs how VC actually works and why founders should prioritizing creating FOMO when raisingüëáüèæI've seen founders with great metrics struggle, and I've seen founders with those same metrics raise millions just because a top VC said yes. In sales, having impressive logos matters. But ultimately, if you can't prove your product solves a customer's problem, they won't buy.VC funding doesn't work like that.VCs know that 90% of their returns will come from 1-2 companies in their portfolio. Missing the next big thing hurts more than backing the wrong thing.So when a respected investor commits, others rush in. Not because the company suddenly got better, but because no one wants to miss out.Yes, fundraising and sales share some DNA:‚Ä¢ You're selling a vision‚Ä¢ You have to sell up the decision-making chain‚Ä¢ You must be able to handle objectionsBut customer decisions are rational: \"Will this solve my problem?\"VC decisions are emotional: \"What if this is the next unicorn and I miss it?\"I think it's important that you understand this difference. Sometimes closing your round isn't about a better pitch - it's about creating FOMO.",
