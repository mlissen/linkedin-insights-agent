Even took one call.But I've come a long way from believing that being a founder means being \"always on\" for Chezie.The 'urgent' startup problems will still be there when you get back. But the moments with the people you love? Those don‚Äôt come around often, so take advantage of them when you can.Founders - take the time off. Your company needs you at your best, not your most burnt out.Your future self (and maybe even spouse) will thank you.",

    "content": "Funding will not save your company.It's tempting for founders to believe that $1M pre-seed will solve their startup's challenges.The truth is that raising capital only magnifies existing problems.Here's exactly how I've seen funding destroy startups instead of saving them:1. Broken product developmentYou believe: \"Funding means we can hire engineers and accelerate our roadmap!\"What happens: You don‚Äôt talk to customers (which you can do without funding), so you create features for misaligned customers who eventually leave. You end up with a product entirely built on what you THOUGHT customers wanted instead of what they would actually pay for.2. Wasteful marketing spendYou believe: \"After we raise, we'll invest in advertising and rapidly grow our user base!\"What happens: You burn through cash on paid acquisition, reaching irrelevant audiences because you never invested time in defining your target customer.3. Slow and inconsistent salesYou believe: \"Funding lets us build a sales team and scale our sales organization!\"What happens: You hire sales reps prematurely without mastering founder-led sales. Without a proven playbook, there's no repeatability, and those hires fail. Plus, you increased your burn with these hires, so now that 24 months of runway you had has shrunk to just 6 months.Here's what I've discovered through building Chezie:Venture capital must be treated as fuel for an existing flame, not the spark itself.- Found product-market fit and ready to scale? Raise money to build faster.- Figured out a way to get in front of customers? Raise money so you can do it more frequently and quickly.- Consistently closing deals and surpassed $1M in ARR? Raise money to hire an SDR who now has a playbook to follow.If you‚Äôre still navigating product development, go-to-market, or sales fundamentals (which is entirely normal, by the way), don‚Äôt raise money.Instead, invest the time to solve these first.Abandon the fantasy that venture capital will rescue you. Embrace constraints, put in the work, and then leverage capital as an accelerant.I'm adding one more example of how founders assume funding will save them in the comments!What's the biggest mistake you made (or saw someone make) after raising their first round? Drop it in the comments - your story might save another founder from making the same error.",

Here‚Äôs the process we followed üëáüèæI‚Äôm a firm believer that every founder should launch a friends and family round, even if traditional VC or external funding isn't in your plans.This is your chance to share wealth creation with the people who‚Äôve always supported you.Our approach was methodical ‚Äì here's the step-by-step:1. Contacted our networkI reached out to everyone in my personal network about our fundraising plans and offered them a chance to invest.I emphasized this was completely optional ‚Äì zero pressure to participate.We'd been building Chezie for 2 years, so people already understood what we were doing.2. Opened an RUVWe partnered with our lawyer to establish a roll-up vehicle (RUV) through AngelList.An RUV let‚Äôs people invest like an online purchase.The best part: all investments are consolidated everything into a single cap table entry. First-time founders should prioritize keeping a clean cap table, and the RUV does just that.3. Hosted a private pitchAfter confirming interest, Dumebi Egbuna and I organized a group presentation via Zoom.We approached it as seriously as a VC meeting. We covered:- Market problem and our solution- Revenue forecasts- Competitive landscape- Customer acquisition strategy+ other components of our pitch.Around 20 people joined. We concluded with a comprehensive Q&A session. The RUV link went out immediately after.4. Followed up and got the checksFor the following two months, I personally answered every question that folks had. Their belief in us meant everything, and I wanted everyone to feel confident about their decision.Some people invested $1,000 (this is the minimum you can do on an RUV). Some invested $10,000+.One friend invested, got a raise at her job, and invested some more üò≠When we closed the RUV, our support circle had invested over $160k!Honestly, thinking about it is STILL crazy to me.Combined with our VC and other funding sources, we hit our goal for the round.Too many first-time founders skip friends and family rounds, assuming their network lacks interest or resources.My recommendation is to trust your community to make their own choices.Your day-one supporters have earned the opportunity to participate. Honor them by making this investment option available.I wrote a complete guide to raising a friends and family round. Click Visit my store at the top of this post to download it for free ü§ùüèæ",

    "content": "The worst thing that happened to our fundraise?We grew to $100k ARR in 4 months.It sounds backwards, but that early traction quickly became our biggest liability.We were so proud of those numbers. All we wanted to do was talk about and show off our logos. Chegg! Ripple! Branch! $100k ARR!We completely ignored what VCs actually care about: potential for outsized outcomes.THE MISTAKEOur initial pitch went something like:\"Our ERG management solution helps companies operate their ERGs better. We're already doing $100k ARR with customers like Chegg and Ripple. We're raising $750k pre-seed.\"VC response every single time: \"That's impressive, but how will you scale to $100M with this?\"We had no answer because we were too busy celebrating our early wins to think about the big picture.THE FIXSo, we flipped our entire approach to focus on how we get big, and *casually* drop our revenue numbers.Our new pitch:\"We want to help enterprises connect their most under-utilized asset (employee resource groups) to their business goals, like building a product or generating sales. Oh, by the way, we're already doing $100k ARR.\"The reception from VCs was almost instant.I remember the second or third time I delivered this new pitch, I watched a VC literally look up from their phone mid-call. They went from half-listening to fully engaged.Same traction. Same customers. Completely different reaction.THE LESSONThere‚Äôs a lesson here for pre-seed founders raising their first rounds:it's (almost) always better to lead with vision and supplement with traction.VCs don't care that you hit $100k ARR.They care that you can hit $100M ARR.Your early traction just proves you can execute and hustle.Show them the massive company you're building first. Then show that you've already figured out how to get customers without their money.That's when they lean in.Early traction is great. But if it becomes the only story you tell, it'll kill your fundraise faster than having no traction at all.I got this advice from a founder who‚Äôs raised over $300M.

    "content": "A VC told me I should \"always be raising\" as a startup founder.Here's why that advice is wrong and why founders should prioritize funding readiness instead.TRADITIONAL ADVICE: \"ALWAYS BE RAISING\"Usually, founders think this means \"attend every VC networking event and take every coffee meeting with a VC that you can.‚ÄùThree problems with this:1. Simply put: it‚Äôs exhausting.2. It means that you‚Äôre spending time you could be building your company on talking to VCs when you don‚Äôt need to.3. It forces founders to look at VC as the only path to funding, which just isn‚Äôt true.After securing over $1.2M in total funding for Chezie, I realized that first-time founders shouldn‚Äôt focus on always raising; they should focus on funding readiness.FUNDING READINESS:Funding readiness is about having a line of sight to multiple sources of funding that are ready when you need them.Last year, we were within 6 months of going out of business. Fortunately, I was funding ready.I had established relationships with multiple funding platforms (none of which were VCs because I knew that wasn‚Äôt a path to quick cash).When it was time to tap into these funding sources, we locked down:‚Üí $100K loan from Invest Atlanta‚Üí $25K revenue-based financing‚Üí A $100K line of credit via invoice factoringAll secured within 6 weeks.WHY THIS WORKS:Staying funding-ready is much less time-consuming than always raising, and it lets you stay at a point of leverage.Remember, you never want to be looking for money when you desperately need it. Get money like this üñïüèæ, not like this üôèüèæ.Funding readiness might be:- Sending monthly investor updates to VCs you want to raise from in the future- Attending at most ONE investor mixer per monthBut it might also look like:- Applying for grants every month- Researching loan options for startups in your cityFunding comes in many forms. The best founders optimize for optionality, not just VC money.Stop thinking \"always be raising\" means endless investor meetings and start building your funding readiness across multiple channels.What's your biggest challenge with funding strategy?

    "content": "I spoke to 4 angel investors who've invested in 75+ startups.Founders dramatically underestimate the number of angels required to close an angel round.Here's how to calculate how many angels you need in your target list üëáüèæMost first-time founders believe they can secure a $250K angel round by simply talking to 10 angels.Wrong. Try doubling that.THE ASSUMPTIONS:For a typical $250K angel round:- Average check size: $25K- # of checks needed: 10- Reply rate from quality outreach: 30%- Meeting-to-close rate (percentage of meetings that turn into a check): 20%Note: From my conversations, if an angel replies to your outreach, you'll likely get a meeting. Legitimate angels receive 10-20 pitches daily, so a response indicates genuine interest.THE FUNNEL:Working backwards from 10 checks at $25K each:1. 10 checks needed √∑ 20% close rate = 50 angels to pitch2. 50 meetings needed √∑ 30% reply rate = 170 angels to contactThat's right. You need 170 angels on your target list.KEY TAKEAWAYS:1. Raising from angels is a sales process. If you‚Äôre raising from angels, you must become a salesperson and treat that 170 number as your quota.2. Every angel I spoke with cited poor outreach as the #1 reason they ignore founders. Do your research. Don't pitch healthcare-focused angels when you're building a construction company.3. Angels move faster than VCs because they don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs approval. If you're aggressive and prepared, you can close an angel round in 6 weeks vs. 6 months for VC.THE REALITY:This math might seem daunting, but it should actually be encouraging.170 quality outreach messages over 6 weeks is doable if you are diligent and follow a process.The key is treating it like the sales process it is.Stop thinking you can \"casually\" raise from angels. Start building that target list of 170+ and get to work.- - -P.S. - Next Wednesday, I‚Äôm publishing my findings in a guide for founders looking to raise from angels!Click the Visit my Store button at the top of this post to subscribe for free or comment \"ANGELS\" below and I'll send it to you directly ü§ùüèæ\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

But before my first $100K win, I wasted hours rewriting the same answers‚Äîand still got rejected.If I were a founder starting from 0, here‚Äôs the process I‚Äôd follow to win my first grant üëáüèæLOG COMMON RESPONSES1. Find three open grants.2. Copy and paste the questions from each grant into a document.3. Use ChatGPT to consolidate the questions into one clean document. These are your CQGs (commonly grant questions).4. Write thoughtful responses to each of these questions in the doc from step 3.5. Congratulations. You now have a CGQ database.APPLYING STRATEGICALLY6. Using my CGQ database, respond to the application questions for the three grants you found in step 1.7. Identify questions from these applications that are not in your CGQ database. Respond to them and add them to your database.8. Submit the 3 applications.9. Open a spreadsheet (I suggest Notion)10. Create a sheet with the following columns: Application name, Due date, Amount, Application status (Not started, In progress, Submitted), Application URL11. Congratulations, you have a grant application tracker.12. Add each of the three grants from step 1 to your tracker.13. Go to your calendar.14. Create 2 weekly time blocks- Block 1: 15 mins: Find grants and add them to your tracker- Block 2: 45 mins: apply to grants15. Every week, review the new grants in your tracker and submit the corresponding applications. Do as many as you can in 45 minutes. Refer to your CGQ database from step 5 to apply more efficiently.16. Repeat weekly until you reach profitability (it‚Äôs much harder to get grants when you don‚Äôt *really* need the money).If you‚Äôre consistent and you make steady progress with your company, you will win non-dilutive grant money to grow faster.P.S. - I made my Grant Application Tracker available for free for founders looking to win their first grant.

We‚Äôre raising $750K to hire engineers to move off of no-code\"Sounds solid, right?Nope. 20 meetings and 0 checks in, I realized I was making a big mistake.I was telling investors how I'd use their money, not how they'd make money.MILESTONE-FOCUSED PITCH:Once I understood venture math, everything changed.My new pitch:\"We're at $100K ARR with seven customers, and our product is a no-code MVP. With $750K, we'll grow to $1M ARR in 15 months - which will allow us to raise our seed round at 2-3x our current valuation.\"WHY THIS WORKS:Pre-seed investors aren‚Äôt investing in today‚Äôs version of your company.They‚Äôre investing in what your company can become. They need to believe that in 12-18 months, you can raise another round at a 2-3x valuation.That means if you‚Äôre raising at a $6M valuation today, your job is to convince investors that you‚Äôll be able to raise at (at least) a $12M valuation down the road.Why do you have to double your valuation?Because VCs need to show their LPs (limited partners; the people who give them money to invest) that they're picking good companies.Happy LPs = more money for the next fund.TAKEAWAY:When fundraising, your job as a founder isn't to show investors your great company.Your only job is to convince them you'll hit the milestones to raise your next round at a higher valuation.The other parts of your pitch (team, product, GTM, etc.) are just there to support the story.What‚Äôs your biggest challenge with fundraising?

    "content": "The biggest mistake I made building my first startup was falling in love with my own idea.It cost me $10K and 1.5 years.Here's how to avoid building something nobody wants to pay for üëáMy co-founder and I spent 1.5 years and $15K of our own money building a job review platform for minorities.Our goal was to create a Glassdoor for us.At the time, I thought that this was something that just had to exist. If we build it, they'll come.Wrong.After 1.5 years, we had to face reality:- 1 paying customer- $400 MRR- 1500 job-seekers but 0 willing to payNeither businesses nor job-seekers would PAY for our platform. They appreciated it, but no one would open their checkbook.Then something unexpected happened.A friend reached out asking if we could help with their ERGs. They had $35K to spend - almost 10x more than we'd ever made working on the job review platform.We pivoted, and within a month of launching as Chezie, we had a 5-figure contract.If I were to start a new company, here's how I'd approach building product:1. Start with customer painTalk to 20+ potential customers. My favorite questions to ask:‚Ä¢ How are you solving that problem today?‚Ä¢ Have you looked for a better solution recently?2. Validate willingness to pay by SELLING (Most important)Here's what I learned after 300+ customer calls:\"I love this idea\" = worthless\"When can I buy?\" = close, but we can do better\"Here's my credit card\" = validationYou have to ask people to pay for your solution. That‚Äôs the only validation that matters.Best case? They buy on the spot.Worst case? They end the call and block you.Either way, you get feedback that helps you understand if you're on the right path.You have to ask people to pay for it early. Words are nice, but a Stripe payment is much better.(Check out Rob Snyder's content for how to find demand by selling)---Don't make the same mistake I did.Focus on learning about your customers first.Building the product becomes way easier when you know exactly what pain you're solving and how much people will pay to fix it.How do you think about building product?P.S. - Want the exact framework I use to validate ideas by selling?

Build my target list of 300+ VCs.2. Prioritize the funds in that list to identify the top 10% (30 funds) that I wanted to raise from based on connections, thesis, brand, similar investments, etc.3. Filter by target list for only these 30 funds4. Go to Crunchbase5. Starting with the first of the 30 funds, search for that fund on Crunchbase6. Look at the fund‚Äôs three most recent investments7. Write down the names, websites, and founders for the 3 most recent investments8. Repeat steps 5-7 for the remaining 29 high-priority funds9. Open LinkedIn10. Send a connection request to the founders of every portfolio company. (Use the template in the image below)11. Open your email12. Send an email to each founder (their email is probably firstname@website.com) asking if they‚Äôd be open to sharing their experience working with the Fund you‚Äôre considering. (Use the template in the image below)13. Schedule and conduct the meetings, asking genuine questions about their founder experience and their relationship with the fund.14. At the end of the meeting (assuming it went well) ask the founder if they‚Äôd be open to introducing you to the fund.Why this works:- Can be done with 0 network- Investors appreciate intros from their portfolio companies more than anything else- Founders are almost always open to helping other founders- Since you‚Äôre in similar spaces, the founder may introduce you to other investorsWill this take a long time? Yes.Will this be more fruitful than cold emailing 300 investors? Also yes.You don‚Äôt need a huge network to get warm intros. You just need a system.

    "content": "We generated our first 100+ qualified leads from a single webinar with zero ad spend.If I were a first-time founder looking to build pipeline fast, here's exactly how I'd do it.Webinars are the most underutilized content tool for founders. We host 1-2 events a month, and they drive millions in pipeline for us.BEFORE THE WEBINAR1. Find a burning topic by searching LinkedIn for questions in your niche. Look for posts with high engagement but outdated answers.2. Identify the perfect host - someone who either works at a notable company OR has a strong following in your space. 3. Create a title that promises transformation, not information. \"From Intent to Impact: How to Get the Most Out of Your ERGs\" beats \"ERG Best Practices\" every time.4. Set up a form for people to register. Keep it short, but include these questions- Name- Email- Company name- Job title/department- Their #1 burning question about [topic]5. Use the questions from the registrations to compile a list of questions for your host. These will be 75% of your fireside chat.6. Create marketing materials for the event.7. Use the marketing materials from step 6 to publicize the webinar on your personal LinkedIn and to your company‚Äôs email list.8. Send the marketing materials from step 6 to your host. Encourage them to promote to their networks (they have influence and will attract potential customers)9. Send reminder emails to people who registered 1 week, 1 day, and 1 hour before the event.10. Test your tech setup 24 hours before. Nothing kills momentum like technical difficulties.AFTER THE WEBINAR (where the magic happens)11. Export your full registration list and attendance lists within 1 hour. Speed matters here.12. Segment your list into three buckets:- HOT: Attended + asked questions + fits your ICP (ideal customer profile) perfectly- WARM: Attended + fits your ICP- NURTURE: Registered but didn't attend + fits your ICP13. For your HOT and WARM leads, use AI to craft personalized emails. These should include:- The webinar recording- Their burning question from registration- The answer to the question (answer it yourself it it wasn‚Äôt directly addressed in the webinar)- Your desire to learn about their role and to share more about your product14. For NURTURE leads, simply send the webinar recording and their burning question + an answer ‚Üí focus on awareness for these folks, not getting a meeting.Check out the image below for a template you can use for this outreach.---Congratulations! You just got your first 100 leads, and they came to YOU!Since that first webinar in October 2021, we've run 60+ events and generated $3M+ in pipeline. No fancy tools. No big budget. Just this repeatable process.What's your biggest challenge with generating leads? Drop it in the comments and I'll help you figure out if webinars could work for you üëáüèæ\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

Customers change everythingWe were doing $50k+ ARR when we won back-to-back grants from Google and Amazon.Having revenue makes EVERYTHING easier.It builds belief in investors. It convinces potential team members that your company is worth joining. It takes pressure off the founding team to raise another round.If you're thinking you need funding to get going, there's a 98% chance you're wrong.2. Don't limit your optionsOnly about 1/3 of our funding has come from traditional VCs.Another 1/3 came equity-free.There are so many more funding options than VC. Loans, revenue-based financing, grants, friends, and family; the list goes on.Stay flexible and be open to whatever funding avenue helps you hit your milestones.The best source of funding is from customers. The second best is simply the one that keeps your doors open.Sometimes that means choosing the unconventional route.

    "content": "If you're fundraising to solve your startup's problems, you've already lost.I learned this after 80+ rejections üëáüèæI spent months pitching VCs, convinced that funding would solve everything.86 rejections later (yes, I counted), I finally understood: I was trying to raise money to close the gap, when I needed to close the gap to raise money.Let me explain.Last week, a founder building a monetization platform for niche creators (think Patreon for X) asked for my advice. She‚Äôd built a solid product and was obsessed with features.But when I asked how she'd get both creators AND users on the platform, he went quiet.\"That's what the funding is for,\" he said.Wrong answer.She‚Äôll struggle to raise until she can walk into a room and say: \"We've cracked distribution. Here are our first 10 users, and here's our path to 1,000.\"That gap between where you are and where investors need you to be? That's your fundraising gap.And if you're a first-time founder without Stanford or YC on your resume, you can't raise with gaps.Here are the 5 fundraising gaps that kill pre-seed rounds:1. Founder perception gapThe stuff you can't change overnight - Stanford pedigree, ex-Google, second-time founder status. If you don't have it, the other gaps become dealbreakers.2. Team gapCan you actually build this? Do you have the expertise? One technical co-founder isn't enough if you're building deep tech.3. Traction gapNot just users - PAYING customers or serious daily/monthly active users. \"We'll monetize later\" doesn't work in 2025.4. Distribution gapA repeatable way to get customers that isn't paid ads. VCs need to see that you can grow without burning their cash on Meta ads.5. Market gapProving the market is both big AND growing. A big stagnant market is just as bad as a small one.The truth is, if you have founder perception working for you, VCs will ignore the other gaps.If you don't (like 99% of us), you need to close these gaps BEFORE you fundraise.The marketplace founder? She needs to spend the next 3 months figuring out distribution, getting her first users, and showing momentum. Then she can raise.Stop fundraising, hoping someone will eventually say yes. Figure out your gaps. Close them. Then raise money to pour fuel on what's already working.What's the biggest gap between where you are today and where you need to be to fundraise?Drop it below - I read every comment and will share specific strategies ü§ùüèæ",

Kula told me: \"60-70% of outreach goes straight to trash because it's not personalized or completely outside my scope.\"How to contact angels the right way:1. Research - Find out what the angel invests in, OR what her background is in so you can identify their thesis2. Personalize - Reference their background, portfolio, or recent content3. Share traction - Lead with milestones that get attention. Revenue, users, a strong team, etc.4.

    "content": "A founder I worked with went from building the 'Salesforce for solopreneurs' to 'client management for fractionals.' Here‚Äôs how I helped her avoid the trap that 99% of first-time founders fall into: starting too broad.The mistake most founders make:First-time founders think they need to solve everything for everyone to maximize their customer base. This is backwards. When you try to sell to everyone, you end up selling to no one.You can only think about serving \"everyone\" once you're mature and need to scale. Until then, start small. Like comically small.Case study: Morgan Smith, founder of ElevoMorgan is a fractional HR consultant juggling multiple clients.Her problem: She's got too many tools.- Bill.com for invoicing- Toggle for time tracking- ClickUp for project management- + dozens moreHer idea: build the \"Salesforce for solopreneurs\" - an all-in-one platform handling everything solopreneurs need.This sounds good, but there‚Äôs one (big) problem.If you build a product for every use case for every customer, you'll do everything just okay.When it comes to building product, the rule of thumb is 10x better or don‚Äôt bother.Instead, start with ONE value prop for ONE type of customer that solves a very painful problem really well.I worked with Morgan to drill down to her personal biggest pain point: client management.Now, she‚Äôs pivoted to building elevo, a client management platform specifically for fractional talent.Here‚Äôs how to niche down like Morgan:1. List your customer types - Morgan had solopreneurs, fractionals, consultants, and contractors2. Pick the one you understand best - She IS a fractional consultant3. Identify their single biggest pain point - For fractionals, it's managing multiple client relationships4. Build that one thing really well - Client management that actually works for how fractionals operatePaypal started as a payments platform solely for eBay sellers.Slack started as a messaging platform for software developers.The biggest companies started way smaller than you might think.If you're a first-time founder, start small and nail a problem for one specific customer type. When it‚Äôs time to worry about scale, you‚Äôll know.If you're a founder who could use someone to bounce ideas off, I'm doing 1-on-1 calls through Hubble!Book time here: https://lnkd.in/enpkFQii\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "Last year, we tried to raise a $250k bridge round to keep the lights on.The results: 30 meetings. Zero interest.Here‚Äôs why raising while desperate is code red for first-time founders and what to do instead.There are three tell-tale signs that a founder is raising out of desperation:- You're pitching survival, not growth - e.g., ‚Äúwe just need a few more months to figure things out‚Äù (this was me)- Your runway is under 6 months, and it shows in your models.- You're pre-revenue, asking investors to fund your experiments instead of scaling what's already working.Investors don't want to save your company. They want to accelerate a rocket ship that's already taking off.When you're desperate, you have zero leverage.Without leverage, one of two things is going to happen:1. Investors will pass, or, maybe worse,2. Investors will give you money, but on terrible terms because they know you either take that money or the company diesIn our case, it was # 1. After 30 meetings, I made the call to stop fundraising and figure out something else.We tried a few options, but ultimately had to make the tough decision to reduce our team.Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did.If I were smart, I would have realized that no VC was going to invest in a potentially sinking ship. I could have taken the two months I spent fundraising and focused on:1. Asking customers to pre-pay in exchange for a discount so we could extend runway2. Finding loan options (like Invest Atlanta)3. Requesting deferred payments from vendorsA year later, we‚Äôre profitable and never have to raise again.But that time we spent raising while desperate was painful.The golden rule for first-time founders raising venture capital:Raise like üñïüèæ, not like üôèüèæ.If you‚Äôre telling investors why you NEED their money, you‚Äôve already lost.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "For my pre-seed, I created a list of 30 target VCs. I quickly learned I needed to 10x that. Here's why first-time founders should identify 300+ funds to raise their first $1M ‚¨áÔ∏èBuilding your investor pipeline isn't about finding a handful of \"perfect fit\" funds.It's about understanding the (pretty low) conversion rates at each stage of the funnel.When I raised our pre-seed for Chezie, for every 10 investors on our target list, I got a meeting with only 3 of them - a 30% target-to-meeting conversion rate.For every 30 meetings, I got just 1 check. That‚Äôs a 3% meeting-to-check conversion rate.Here are some benchmarks for a first-time founder to use:- 50% list-to-response rate - For every 10 outreach attempts, only 5 investors will respond at all- 40% response-to-meeting rate - Of those who respond, only 4 out of 10 will agree to take a meeting- 5% meeting-to-check rate - Of those who take meetings, only 1 in 20 will actually write a checkMost people you reach out to won't respond.Of those who do respond, most will turn you down.And of those who actually meet with you, only 5% will write a check.If you're a first-time founder without YC backing or previous exits, don‚Äôt plan on better conversion rates than this.Now, let's reverse-engineer what this means for a $1M round.On average, to raise $1M, you‚Äôll need to secure 3 checks. The typical structure:- 1 lead check: $750k- 1 strong follow-on: $150k- 1 smaller follow-on: $100kLastly, let‚Äôs work backwards to figure out how many funds you need to add to your list:1. At 5% meeting-to-check odds, each investment requires 20 meetings2. 3 investments √ó 20 meetings = 60 total meetings needed3. At 40% response-to-meeting rate, each meeting requires 2.5 responses4. 60 meetings √ó 2.5 responses = 150 responses needed5. At 50% list-to-response rate, you need 300 investors on your target listThis sounds harsh, but it‚Äôs better to go in with realistic expectations than get burnt out after rejection #30.Fundraising success is about two things: 1. persistence, and 2. strategy.Knowing how many investors to identify is your foundation.A rule of thumb for any first-time founder raising their first $1M: start with 300 funds and go from there.Save this post and share with a founder friend!P.S. - I detailed this process in my CREAM eBook.

This would be our first customer, and SSO is a reasonable request for an enterprise company.Instead of digging deeper, I immediately promised we could build it.6 weeks of back-and-forth. Weekly check-ins with their team. Constant updates on our progress building the integration.\"Great news! We have Okta SSO!\"Then crickets.A few weeks later, the customer got back to us to let us know they were going a different direction.After hundreds of sales conversations, I know one thing for sure:Products are bought, not sold.When customers really want your product, they find reasons to buy it. When they don't, they find excuses not to.Most \"if you build this, we'll sign\" requests are just polite ways to say no.90% of these customers won't sign anyway. The other 10% will sign and make your life miserable with endless feature requests.Whenever I talk to a customer who requests a feature, I ask one question:\"If we had [feature] today, would you sign the contract this week?\"If yes, find a path forward (add it as a customization in the contract, extend the term by a few months to factor in the build, etc.).If no, call it out and move on.Luckily for us, 70% of our customers now use that Okta integration. So it wasn't a total loss.But I learned to stop chasing customers who are looking for reasons to say no.Funny enough, I‚Äôm 3.5 years into building Chezie, and I still find myself biting on feature requests from potential customers.The difference is that I now ask the hard questions first.

It (almost) never works.Instead, focus on getting warm introductions for your first 10 meetings with this process:1. Open a spreadsheet with the following columns: - Person I know - LinkedIn URL - VC Connections2. In column A, list my top 20 closest connections that work in tech, startups, or venture capital. These should be CLOSE connections. Like you‚Äôd buy them dinner type of close.3. Open LinkedIn4. For the names in column A (people you know), go to their profile and copy/paste their LinkedIn profile URL in column B5. Go to the first person you know‚Äôs LinkedIn page6. Click Connections7. Click All filters8. Scroll down to find the Keywords section9. In the Company field, enter ‚Äúventures‚Äù10. In the Title field, enter ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù11. Copy each of the names that appear into the VC Connections column of your spreadsheet12. Go back to Step 11 and enter ‚Äúprincipal‚Äù13. Repeat steps 11 and 12 for the following title keywords: partner, analyst, platform, associate14. Go back to step 10 and replace ‚Äúventures‚Äù with ‚Äúcapital‚Äù15. Repeat steps 11-14.16. Repeat step 15 with partners, equity, fund, investments17. Go back to step 5 and repeat the entire process (steps 6-16) for the next Person you Know in your spreadsheet18. Email each connection individually and ask which of their VC connections they‚Äôd be able/open to introducing you to (this is why you want to list only close connections in step 2)19. Clean up your spreadsheet to include ONLY people you can get introduced to from the People you Know20. For each VC connection you can get an introduction to, go to the fund‚Äôs website21. Check to see that the fund‚Äôs thesis (tech, healthcare, B2B SaaS, etc.), geography, and stage match your company22. Clean up your spreadsheet to include ONLY funds that match23. Email each Person you Know asking for an introduction to [VC connection‚Äôs name] at [VC connection‚Äôs fund]24. Watch as the introductions come through and you book your first 10 (or more) meetings.First-time founders should plan on 100 meetings to close a $1M round.It‚Äôs a numbers game.Follow this process to get your first 10.I share a few more tactical ways to get VC meetings in my free, 62-page CREAM Ebook.

    "content": "50+ VCs ignored our meeting requests. Then we changed one sentence and everything shifted, ultimately helping us close our $790k pre-seed. Here‚Äôs why your one-liner matters and how to write one that gets investors interested.Your one-liner is a single sentence that helps investors understand what you‚Äôre building and why it can be huge. Our original one-liner was just okay:\"Chezie helps companies manage their ERGs with an all-in-one solution for tracking members, events, and budget.\"When I used this in my forwardable email, the results were discouraging. A lot of ‚Äúno, thanks‚Äù or worst yet‚Ä¶ crickets.After some reflection, I realized it was missing two critical elements:1. The size of the opportunity2. Our path to capturing itSo I updated our one-liner pivoted to this:\"Chezie is poised to help 57,000+ companies around the world create better products, build more inclusive workplaces, and ultimately drive business results by reimagining what's possible with their most underutilized asset: employee resource groups.\"Big difference.Our meeting request success rate jumped from 10% to 40%.Your one-liner needs to do more than explain what you do. It MUST show the massive opportunity you're chasing.Here's a one-liner template I wish I had earlier:\"[Company name] helps [type of customer + market size] in [industry] achieve [2-3 desired outcomes] with [your solution].\"Quick example (for a fictional AI healthcare startup) to drive it home:‚ùå Bad: \"Our AI platform helps medical offices schedule patient appointments.\"‚úÖ Great: \"Our AI scheduling solution enables 230,000+ medical practices across the US to reduce no-shows by 70% and increase revenue by $200K annually by revolutionizing how they manage patient appointments.\"See the difference?One final tip: don‚Äôt put too much into it. Your only goal with your one-liner is to get an investor‚Äôs attention enough to make them take the next step (respond to your email, schedule a call, etc.).If you‚Äôre raising and struggling to get meetings, change your one-liner and watch how investors respond.To my fellow founders: What pitch pivots helped you secure investor meetings?

You get the point. It turns out that I wasn't protecting quality. I was slowing down growth.The solution? Playbooks (otherwise known as SOPs)Instead of hiring more people, we built playbooks for every process. These aren‚Äôt manuals; they're step-by-step guides that let anyone (contractors, team members, even our admin) handle tasks that used to require Dumebi Egbuna's or my time.Here‚Äôs the 10-step process I use to build our playbooks:1. Identify your tech stack - Notion for storage, Figma for diagrams2. Outline your playbook - 20% of the playbook should answer who and why. The remaining 80% is how the process is done3. Use AI to find gaps - upload your outline to ChatGPT and ask it to identify gaps in your playbook4. Update your outline - Incorporate the AI feedback5. Generate interview questions - Let AI act as an expert in whatever process you‚Äôre documenting. Ask it for interview questions6. Respond to questions - Respond to the questions (I use Wispr Flow) with detailed answers7. Draft first version - Have AI write it section by section8. Refine until comprehensive - Fine-tune each section until you‚Äôre happy with it9. Add visual elements - Optional, but these make complex processes clear10. Share with your team - Share with your team to read asynchronously and then debrief on a callThe ROI is insane.Building our QA playbook took ~12 hours. Two weeks in, and I‚Äôve already gotten that time back. If you zoom out, I anticipate getting 50+ hours back.Now our admin handles most of the QA, I focus on high-value work, and our quality has improved because she approaches testing like a real user would.You can't scale by doing everything yourself. Eventually, founders must release the reins and start building systems, not dependencies.Good processes don't slow you down; they free you up.We review our playbooks every six months to keep them current. The investment in time upfront pays off BIG down the road.Be honest, what process are you hoarding that could be turned into a playbook?

You'll lose track of who you've talked to, forget to follow up with interested investors, and miss opportunities because you can't stay organized.A proper CRM helps you stick to a process and ensures sure nothing falls through the cracks.Start by opening a spreadsheet. I use Notion since you can relate columns to other databases, but Google Sheets or Airtable would also work. Next, add the following columns:1. Name of fund 2. Investor contact - list 2-3 people from the fund who make investment decisions3. Fund website URL4. Funding stage - pre-seed, seed, etc.5. Location - don‚Äôt pitch people who only invest in Europe if you‚Äôre in ATL6. Industry focus - don't pitch healthcare VCs your fintech startup7. Check size - know if they write $25k or $1M checks, so you know the value of your pipeline8. Who can intro? - *MOST IMPORTANT* map who you know that can introduce you to someone at the fundYou can get creative with this! I added columns for the fund‚Äôs portfolio page and a column for the fund‚Äôs application link (if it was available).Now, all you need to do is fill it out.Go through Crunchbase and public investor databases to add funds to this list. Your target should be 300 funds.Fundraising is a numbers game with a 95%+ rejection rate. Without proper tracking, you'll lose deals in the chaos, and with a conversion rate that‚Äôs already so low, founders can‚Äôt afford to let anything slip through the cracks.I break down the entire process‚Äîincluding my exact CRM template‚Äîin my free CREAM ebook.Click \"Visit my store\" at the top of this post to download it ü§ùüèæWhat columns would you add?

I see it as an opportunity.Here's how to talk about your competition in a way that actually helps you close the round üëáüèæWhen VCs ask, \"Who are your competitors?\" too many founders default to defensive positioning rather than using the question to get investors excited about their company AND the market they're in.Founders usually address competition in one of two ways:1. The 2x2 matrix with your company magically positioned in the top right2. The feature comparison table where you check every box, and competitors don'tEither way, the goal of this slide is to say \"our product is 10x better than our competition, so we aren‚Äôt worried about them.‚Äù(If your pitch deck looks like this, don‚Äôt feel bad; mine did too)How founders SHOULD talk about competition:Instead of just explaining why you're better, use competition to:1. Validate market size and investor hype around the space 2. Establish benchmarks for growth and valuation3. Showcase your competitive advantages to the bigger playersDon‚Äôt bash competition; use their success to bolster your case.Real-world case study: Regimen AII recently worked with Rey Mendoza from Regimen AI to help him plan for his upcoming raise. His main competitors are Kajabi and BetterUp.The old way Rey might position against competitors:\"Kajabi and BetterUp aren't AI-first. Our platform gives creators more control and better tools.\"The new way that gets investors excited:\"Kajabi reached $100M ARR in 5 years with 56,000 subscribers, while BetterUp hit similar revenue in 8 years and raised at a $4.7B valuation. They've proven this market is massive and venture-backable.But both were built pre-AI revolution. Our AI-first approach and focus on creator autonomy positions us to not only capture new market share, but also potentially convert their customers who want more advanced capabilities.\"See the difference? The second approach:- Uses competitor metrics to validate market potential- Establishes concrete benchmarks for your own growth trajectory- Shows you understand the competitive landscape AND have identified a legitimate openingWhen VCs ask about competition, they're really asking:1. Do you understand your market?2. Can you articulate your unique advantage?3. Do you have realistic growth expectations?Every investor question is an opportunity. Don't just defend against competition - use it to prove your thoughtfulness and strengthen your case.Steal the template in the slide design below (made in Pitch) and update your competition slide to make it an asset ü§ùüèæWhat's your approach to discussing competitors in investor pitches?h/t Tony E.

And the majority of us didn‚Äôt go to Stanford or work at Google.99% of founders fall into groups 4 and 5.If you‚Äôre in the 99% (like me), then you‚Äôre an average founder in VC terms.And because you‚Äôre an average founder, you can‚Äôt expect the same outcomes as an ‚Äúabove-average‚Äù founder:- You probably won‚Äôt be able to close a round in 2 weeks- You probably won‚Äôt be able to raise money pre-revenue- You probably won‚Äôt be able to hire the ‚Äúbest‚Äù talent (like the early Uber engineer who needs a $300k salary)There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being an average founder if you know the game you‚Äôre playing.Instead of trying to do what the Group 1-3 founders do, try:- Creating a PROCESS for your fundraise- Getting paying customers to validate your idea THEN going after VC- Hiring fractional or contract talent instead of full-time employees to keep costs lowAll of the traditional startup advice was built for the ‚Äúabove-average‚Äù founder.If you‚Äôre in the 99%, stop following their playbook and start building yours.Your time will come, but it starts with winning the game you‚Äôre in today.What‚Äôs one piece of traditional startup advice you‚Äôve stopped following?

    "content": "You've sent 200 cold emails and gotten 3 VC meetings.You've had 30 first meetings and zero second meetings.You can still raise, but you first need to get strategic about what you fix.Fundraising has a funnel, just like sales.First-time founders should think of that funnel in three stages:1. Top of funnel - getting the meeting2. Middle of funnel - going from first meeting ‚Üí due diligence3. Bottom of funnel - close (i.e., getting a check)When I raised for Chezie, I had challenges at each stage. Here's how to debug your fundraising process:TOP OF FUNNEL: Getting the meetingCommon challenges:- You send hundreds of cold emails but can‚Äôt get investor meetingsWhat's probably happening:‚Üí You aren‚Äôt prioritizing warm intros‚Üí You aren‚Äôt describing your company in a way that shows market size or urgency‚Üí You're targeting the wrong investors (wrong stage/sector)What to do instead:‚Üí Stop cold emailing; always try for a warm intro first. If you don‚Äôt have a direct contact, ask a friend of a friend.‚Üí Only contact investors that invest in AT LEAST two of the following: your geography, your industry, or your stageMIDDLE OF FUNNEL: Progressing to Due DiligenceCommon challenge:- Lots of first meetings, no second meetingsWhat's probably happening:‚Üí You're not getting investors excited enoughWhat to do instead:- Focus on the big vision; tell the investor what the world looks like if you‚Äôre successful.- Find ways to demonstrate that you‚Äôre building what COULD be a billion-dollar business- Ask directly: \"Do you want to learn more, or are you passing?‚ÄùBonus pro tip: Never send more than two follow-ups to VCs. If they don‚Äôt respond after the second, it‚Äôs a pass. Keep it pushing.BOTTOM OF FUNNEL: CloseCommon challenges:- Investors seem interested but won't commit (e.g., \"We like it but want to see more traction\")- The process drags on for weeks without a firm ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚ÄôWhat's probably happening:‚Üí There‚Äôs no lead investor to create momentum‚Üí You haven't built urgency around the roundWhat to do instead:- If possible, get at least one check before you formally start raising (even if it‚Äôs from friends and family or an accelerator). This builds urgency.- Give investors a reasonable deadline for a decisionBonus protip 2: If the investor passes, ask for reasons. Usually, at this stage in the funnel, they will share feedback that you can use to improve your pitch for future investors.- - -Each stage of your fundraising funnel tells you exactly what to fix, but 95% of founders try to brute force it by simply sending more emails.Your fundraising challenges aren't random. They're predictable (and fixable).Which stage is giving you the most trouble? Drop it in the comments and I'll help you debug it ü§ùüèæ",

Meanwhile, I watch pre-seed companies with 15+ people and Series A startups employing 25+, wondering what they're thinking ü§îStartup culture encourages founders to celebrate having big teams. Founders treat new hires like funding announcements‚Äîthey broadcast them for everyone to see how ‚Äòwell‚Äô they‚Äôre doing.But in reality, only two metrics truly count: happy customers and revenue.The best approach to recruiting is simple: hire when it hurts. That means:- The founding team is regularly pulling 12+ hour days- Your team shows clear signs of exhaustion and productivity declines as a result- Your company starts to miss things that previously weren‚Äôt a problem (support tickets, sales follow-ups, etc.)Even if it hurts, hiring should be your last resort. Before looking to grow your team, consider:- Looking for freelancers and part-time specialists- Implementing software tools ($200/month is far cheaper than $100k/year for a new hire)- Incorporating AI and automation like @zapier to multiply your current team‚Äôs productivityYour only goal as a founder is to stay alive, and you do that by minimizing costs.The simplest way to minimize costs is to hire thoughtfully and intentionally.Celebrate staying in business over expanding your team.How do you think about startup hiring?

Here‚Äôs why you need TWO versions of your pitch deck and how to craft each üëáüèæIf you‚Äôre fundraising, you should have two decks: 1. A shared deck2. A presentation deck The difference between them is subtle but huge if you want to raise VC.1Ô∏è‚É£ A shared deck - to be sent via email as you ask for introductions to investors, or send cold emails.- Use complete headlines that summarize key points- Include sufficient context so it makes sense without you- Make it skimmable with bold text highlighting key metrics- Includes citations/sources2Ô∏è‚É£ A presentation deck - to be displayed during pitches to GUIDE your pitch, not do the presenting for you. - Limit text to 10 words per slide maximum- Use large, impactful numbers (57,000 companies!)- Rely on visuals, graphics, and icons to tell the story- Keep slides simple - YOU are the presentation, not the deckWhen I switched to this dual approach, it was easier to engage investors. They asked better questions.My pitches became conversations instead of my clicking to the next slide for the investor. The worst thing that can happen during a pitch is for you to share a great story or point about your traction, but the investor isn‚Äôt paying attention because they‚Äôre too busy reading the essay that you put on your slides.

The mistake most founders make here is thinking that they don‚Äôt need to think about competition because their product offers something new. Don‚Äôt be one of those founders. Consider your competition and what sets you apart. This is your unique value; it‚Äôs things like your pricing, available integrations, or your interface. - - -The second kind of competition is what first-time founders often overlook. It‚Äôs how your customers are ALREADY solving the problem you‚Äôre working on. In our case, our customers were using a disjointed system to manage their communities:Slack, spreadsheets, distro lists, you name it. In 99% of our early sales calls, we had to explain why Chezie was a better solution than the status quo, not why we were better than other platforms.We sold them on the amount of time they lost using those systems, and more importantly, the opportunity cost of *not* using a dedicated solution for their groups: Missing data about impact, a poor member experience, and an inability to expand the program and secure more budget.Unless there‚Äôs already a huge player in your space (for example, if you‚Äôre creating a better version of Slack), the status quo is what you should focus 90% of your time on. The founders who win aren't the ones who ignore competition‚Äîthey're the ones who understand it, respect it, and then build something better anyway.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "An investor wasted 3 months of a founder's time before revealing he had no money to invest. Believe it or not, VCs are incentivized to operate this way. If you're a first-time founder raising VC, here are 3 questions you should ask every investor to determine their seriousness üëáüèæ1. Are you actively investing?The investor might be closing his fund or between funds I and II. In either case, asking this gets straight to the point. Either way, if they aren‚Äôt actively writing checks, thank them for their time and move on to the next investor. 2. What's your decision-making process and timeline? Every investor should have a process for making decisions. Even solo GPs have LPs to report to. If she can‚Äôt clearly answer how she makes investment decisions or how long that process takes, keep it moving. 3. What percentage of your current fund have you already allocated? Like #1, this helps you understand if the investor is actively cutting checks, but it goes deeper.If the investor has a $20M fund and only 10% is allocated, they have plenty of money to work with and might be less judicious with how they spend it. Alternatively, a VC who has allocated 85% of their fund might still be actively investing but could be super stringent or have limited capacity for follow-on investments.- - -Raising money is a two-way street. While you're asking for money, you're also interviewing the investor.ALWAYS take 3-5 minutes in your VC calls to ask the investor questions and gauge their seriousness about your company. Your time is your most valuable asset as a founder. Don‚Äôt waste it on an investor who never planned to write you a check.Founders, what other questions do you ask to qualify VCs?

    "content": "When I raised my pre-seed, I spent 2 months focusing on points that didn't matter. We closed the round when I realized I only needed to focus on two things:1. Proving that you have a path to a big vision2. Proving that the money is the only thing between you today and you getting to the next milestone on that pathThat's it.VCs want to know that they are funding something huge. Something that will change the way a large number of people do something (business teams, consumers, etc).They also want to know that if they give you $1M, you're going to multiply that. That $1M will turn into $2M in revenue, a redesigned product, or a new GTM motion to get your next 100 customers.When raising for Chezie, I focused on what I THOUGHT was important:- Product- Team- Market opportunity+ Competition, business model, blah blah blahWhile this is important, none of this matters if you can't pitch your vision and next milestone.The product, market size, competition, team, etc. are all just complementary to your vision and next milestone.- If you nail the complementary stuff but miss on vision and milestone, you won't raise.- If you nail the vision and milestone, but you suck at pitching the complementary stuff, you'll successfully raise VC.- If you nail the vision, milestone, AND complementary stuff, you'll raise quickly and abundantly.It's that simple.So next time you're building your pitch deck, start with these two questions:1. \"What world-changing vision am I building toward?\"2. \"What specific milestone will this money help me achieve?\"Nail those, and you've already won 90% of the battle. Everything else is just supporting evidence.Don't overcomplicate it.Are you raising VC for the first time? Comment or connect + DM me any questions you have!

I avoided this with my 3-step process üëáüèæWhen raising VC, momentum is everything. The founder who lost out on that $500k check was asked for a financial model. Because they didn‚Äôt properly prepare, they had to take a week to make it from scratch. By the time they sent it over, the investor had moved on.Avoid this mistake by breaking your raise into three steps: pre-fundraising, fundraising, and maintaining. PRE-FUNDRAISING (6+ months before):People think fundraising is all about non-step investor meetings. They ignore the prep work.During this stage, you should:- Build your target investor list and connect the dots for warm intro requests- Prepare ALL docs (pitch deck, financial model, market calculations)- Draft email templates (forwardable emails, follow-ups)FUNDRAISING (2-3 months):In this phase, you‚Äôre:- Taking 4-5 investor meetings a day- Pitching and tweaking your deck weekly- Following up with investors (up to 3 times, then move on)- Responding to requests from investors in due diligence- Closing the roundIf you've done pre-fundraising right, you spend 100% of your energy on meetings and relationship-building, not scrambling to create documents.MAINTENANCE (ongoing):Traditional advice tells you always to be raising, but that‚Äôs wrong. Maintain relationships with investors with a system:- Send monthly investor updates- Schedule quarterly check-ins with high-priority investorsCan you raise VC without this process? Of course!Can you raise VC without ANY process? Probably not. Before you raise venture capital, create a plan.

But here‚Äôs what happened behind the scenes building Chezie:- 100+ VCs told us no- Built and laid off our team. Twice.- Got sued by a DEI consultant.- Lost customers during the DEI pullback.- Repositioned. Signed some new customers.- Questioned everything. Bought back in. Questioned everything again.Not exactly the journey my immigrant parents imagined when they brought us to the U.S. in 1997. But that‚Äôs the beauty of being a founder. The hardest days teach you the most, and the low points make you appreciate the wins that much more.And I wouldn't trade this journey for anything. I learned more in the first 12 months as a founder than in my 5 years consulting.If you're thinking about starting something, I can promise two things:1. It‚Äôll be one of the hardest things you ever do.2. It‚Äôll be worth it.Take the leap, and if you need some help, check out some of my resources and essays.

    "content": "The best fundraising advice I ever received came from a founder who's raised $353M:Raise on traction or vision, but never both.In a brief interaction with Christina Cacioppo of Vanta, she shared this nugget with me. VCs want to invest in businesses that can be MASSIVE. Your job as a founder is to prove that you're building something that can reach that scale.If you're early-stage, you might be able to prove it with your traction, but it's unlikely.For Chezie, raising on traction was leading with something like this:\"We've grown to $100k ARR in 6 months with 5 enterprise customers.\"We thought that this traction would be more than enough for VCs to invest, but there was one problem:We couldn't tell how this grows to $100M in ARR.Sure, $100k is impressive.But VCs don't invest for $100k. Or $1M. Or even $10M.Every VC must believe that what you're building can grow to $100M ARR.If they don't believe that, there's nothing you can say to get their buy-in. It doesn't matter how much traction you have, how great your product is, or how impressive your team is.It's $100M or pass.So, after 25-ish meetings, we pivoted to raising on vision:\"We want to help enterprises connect their most under-utilized asset (employee resource groups) to their business goals, like building a product or generating sales.‚ÄùBoom.That's a vision-first story that a venture capitalist can get excited about.And it worked. When we switched from pitching traction to pitching vision, our meetings changed completely. Investors leaned in, and the right questions were asked. And finally, the checks ($800k worth) started coming in.Traction sells the present, but vision sells the future. And VCs are in the business of betting on futures.So, if you're a first-time founder struggling to raise money, ask yourself this: Am I trying to sell both traction and vision? Choose one lane (probably your vision) and go all in. Your bank account will thank you.What‚Äôs the best fundraising advice you ever got? Share in the comments üëáüèæ",

Now you've got a product that solves surface-level problems for everyone but deep problems for no one.2Ô∏è‚É£ Zero-ROI marketing effortsYou think: \"Once we raise, we can pour money into ads and scale customer acquisition!\"Reality: You pour money into paid channels, burning cash and targeting the wrong people because you never took the time to truly understand your ideal customer.3Ô∏è‚É£ Inconsistent salesYou think: \"We'll use the money to hire SDRs and build a sales team!\"Reality: You rush to hire SDRs before nailing founder-led sales. No playbook means no consistency, and those SDRs show no increase in ARR.4Ô∏è‚É£ RecruitingYou think: \"With VC funding, we can finally afford top talent with competitive salaries!\"Reality: Expensive hires look great on paper, but they'll struggle without proper foundation or clarity around what success looks like.Here's what I've learned building Chezie:Venture capital should ALWAYS be used as FUEL for a fire, not tinder.If you've figured something out and want to grow faster? Raise VC and pour fuel on the fire.But if you're still struggling with go-to-market, sales, product, etc. (which is 100% okay), take the time to figure that out first.Stop thinking venture capital will save you.Work with constraints. Do the work. Then use VC as fuel.What misconceptions have you seen founders have with VC? Share in the comments!",

    "content": "99% of founders treat their market opportunity slide as a fundraising formality. In all 87 of my investor meetings, I used it as my chance to prove I was the 1% who did the extra work.Here‚Äôs how to calculate your market size to impress investors üëáüèæWhen proving your billion-dollar opportunity (which you MUST do for VC funding), you need to understand two approaches:TOP-DOWN METHOD:Top-down is the total amount of money spent in your industry.For Chezie, that breaks down into:- $40B annually on employee experience/DEI- $8B on ERGs (our TAM)This approach works for high-level conversations. \"Companies spend $8B on ERGs but have zero data on what's working.\"Most founders make the mistake of stopping there. VCs will immediately see this as shallow research because it's too broad ‚Äì not all $8B goes to software platforms like ours. This is where the 1% of founders do the extra work with a bottoms-up analysis.BOTTOMS-UP ANALYSIS:A bottoms-up analysis involves calculating the total number of potential customers and multiplying that by your price. Here's our breakdown:- Potential customers: 57k companies with ERGs- Average contract value: $45kSAM = 57k √ó $45k = $2.56B- Benchmark market share (using a leading HR tech platform like Workday for comparison): 20%SOM = 20% of $2.56B = $513MIn plain English, our addressable market value is $2.56B, and if we grow to own the market the same way other HR platforms have, we will generate over $500M in annual revenue.When I walked investors through these calculations with my market sizing slide, I could literally see their posture change. They lean in. They start taking notes. They recognized me as a founder who was thorough and serious.The bottoms-up approach shows you've done your homework, understand your business intimately, and can speak the language investors respect.As founders, our job is to make it as easy as possible for investors to say yes. It took me 2 days to build my market sizing model in 2022, but you can do it in under 2 hours with Perplexity.A well thought-out market sizing model might be the difference between a passed deal and your next funding round.What‚Äôs your market size, and how‚Äôd you go about calculating it?

    "content": "One of the worst things first-time founders can do is follow popular startup advice like ‚Äúhire the best people.‚ÄùThese mantras weren‚Äôt created with us in mind. Here are three standard pieces of advice that you should rethink:1. ‚ÄúHire the best people‚Äù üë•What it should be: \"Hire the best people you can afford.\"When investors tell you to \"hire the best,\" they're often picturing someone with Stanford credentials and FAANG experience‚Äîa \"best\" that's incredibly costly.We once tried raising more money than we needed to afford engineers way out of our price range. Bad move.For first-time founders who are often underfunded, focus on hiring the best talent you can afford. For me at Chezie, this means:- Hiring a contract UI/UX designer for 10 hours/week and using tools like Vercel v0 to bring ideas to life BEFORE sending to the designer to create them in Figma.- Hiring developers in Mexico and Kenya who work for 50% of what a US-based developer charges.2. \"Move fast and break things\" üí•What it should be: \"Move deliberately and stay compliant\"During its rise, Uber once threw a Vegas party that resulted in $10M+ in hotel damages. Can you imagine any non-white male founder getting away with that?When new founders \"break things,\" we rarely get second chances. We can't afford to operate in legal gray areas or burn bridges.Instead, move deliberately, stay lean, and push the limits without crossing the line.3. \"Always be raising\" üí∞What it should be: \"Always keep investors within arm's reach.\"If you‚Äôre fundraising, you‚Äôre fundraising. If you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre not.You shouldn‚Äôt be taking meetings or attending fundraising events when you're not actively raising.Instead, send quality monthly updates to keep investors informed. Schedule quarterly check-ins with high-priority investors you‚Äôre targeting for a future round. Build relationships without the constant fundraising treadmill. Following traditional startup advice will do more harm to your company than good. What other startup advice have you had to adapt as a first-time founder? Share in the comments!",

    "content": "I needed to pitch 300 investors to close our $780k pre-seed round. Most founders quit after 30.Here is how to calculate the number of funds you need to identify before you raise VC. ‚¨áÔ∏èYour investor pipeline is a list of funds and angel investors you want to invest in your round. Think of it as a funnel (with some rough conversion rates).For every 10 investors on our target list, I got a meeting with only 3 of them - a 30% target-to-meeting conversion rate.For every 30 meetings, I got just 1 check. That‚Äôs a 3% meeting-to-check conversion rate.Unless you're YC-backed or a founder with a proven track record, I wouldn't plan on a target-to-meeting conversion rate higher than 50% or a meeting-to-check conversion rate higher than 10%.Knowing this, you need to work backward to figure out how many investors you need on your list. For a typical $2M round, that looks like:- 1 lead investor for $1M- 1 follow-on investor for $500k- 1 follow-on investor for $300k- $200k in smaller checks from angels and friends/familyThat's 3 institutional checks to form your round. What does that mean in practice?- With a 5% meeting-to-check conversion rate, you need 20 meetings for each check- 3 checks √ó 20 meetings = 60 total investor meetings needed- With a 40% outreach-to-meeting success rate, each meeting requires 2.5 outreach attempts- 60 meetings √ó 2.5 outreach attempts = 150 investors on your target listAnd for underrepresented founders facing bias, double these numbers.This isn't meant to discourage you as a founder; it's meant to give you perspective and get your mind right before you start raising.Anyone can raise money if they're persistent and strategic about it. Understanding how many investors you need to identify is the first step in that journey.--P.S. - I write about this in detail in my free CREAM ebook on how to raise VC.

If you were a founder who got rejected from YC yesterday, here's what you should do next: 1. Figure out your go-to-marketEveryone loves to jump into building products. But that‚Äôs the easy (ish) part. What‚Äôs hard is figuring out how to get your product in front of customers. With Chezie we realized that live webinars drove 300-400 leads to our top of funnel every time we hosted one, so we doubled down on them.The result: 60% of our pipeline came inbound. This was huge for getting us from $100-500k ARR.2. Get 5 customers who LOVE your productYou‚Äôd rather have 5 customers who love your product than 25 who are lukewarm. Lukewarm = indifference.Indifference means that the customer won‚Äôt hesitate to stop using your product if and WHEN times get hard. We learned that the hard way and churned some of our early customers who weren‚Äôt the best fits. 3. Decide if you want to re-applyYC is the Harvard of startup accelerators. That‚Äôs not up for debate. However, there are ways to get 90% of the benefits without giving up 15% of your company. - Check out YC‚Äôs startup school for lessons on building a startup. - Raise money from friends and family for way less equity. - Join an equity-free incubator to build relationships with other founders.Will the above experience be the same as YC? Of course not.But ask yourself: is that extra 10% worth 15% of your company? Getting rejected from YC is an inevitability for 99% of startup founders. If you just got denied, use it as fuel.

We spent months analyzing \"competitors\" in the community software space and preparing sales arguments for why we were better.But our real competition turned out to be something totally different.Spreadsheets. Slack channels. Google Drive.Companies have managed their ERGs this way for years.It's messy and wildly inefficient, but it's familiar. And familiarity is a powerful force.Today, when we pitch to customers, we rarely mention other software platforms.Instead, we focus on why it's worth changing their existing processes.We talk about the hidden costs of their current approach, the time and cost savings the customer will see, and the data they‚Äôre missing out on with their disconnected tools.In most cases, founders are competing with a set of existing, one-size-fits-all tools like spreadsheets and Google Docs.When you understand this, you approach everything differently:1. Your sales strategy becomes about change management, not feature comparison.2. Your marketing focuses on the pain of the status quo, not other solutions.3. Your customer success becomes about proving that the change was worth it.So founders, as you build your companies, remember:Don't just ask \"Why are we better than Competitor X?\"Ask \"Why should someone change how they've always done things?\"Answer that question well, and you'll overcome your biggest competition.What status quo is your product fighting against?\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

They're looking for reasons to say no, and they have dozens of meetings every week with founders who all believe their company is the next unicorn.Your job in that first meeting is simply to:- Address enough objections to keep them curious- Demonstrate you understand your market- Show you have the right team to execute- Leave them wanting to learn moreEven the fastest deals typically take 2-3 meetings before a term sheet, and that's lightning speed in the VC world.So, instead of trying to get a check in one meeting, focus on being impressive enough to make them want to continue the conversation. If you do that, you won the meeting.What other fundraising misconceptions have you encountered? Let me know in the comments üëá\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

Many founders don't have this choice.That's optionality.When founders don‚Äôt have optionality, bad things happen. - They raise money from VCs on terrible terms or even on down rounds, diluting themselves and their employees- They build every feature that every customer asks for instead of focusing on one ICP.

I'm seeing a lot of content on LinkedIn praising bootstrapping and talking down on taking VC because it (sometimes) leaves founders with little to show for their work. It's about building the company YOU want to develop.The problem isn't venture capital.The problem is how VC has warped founders' mindsets about building companies.You don't have to raise multiple rounds, hire a huge team, and chase a billion-dollar valuation. But you also don‚Äôt have to bootstrap 100% of the way, fund the company with your personal savings, struggle to pay yourself, and avoid experiment bets because you don‚Äôt can‚Äôt take the financial risk.If you‚Äôre struggling to figure out how to fund your startup, consider this: 1. What's the minimum amount you need to validate your idea?2. How much risk can you genuinely afford to take?3.

Here‚Äôs how I reworked my strategy to close my $790k pre-seed üëáüèæInvestors get (literally) hundreds of cold emails from founders every day. Many won‚Äôt even take a meeting with a founder unless someone they know introduces them.Instead of cold emailing investors, send your cold emails to people who can connect you to those investors. Two reasons why this works:1. Connectors get far fewer cold emails than investors, so they're more likely actually to open and read what you send2. They're often happy to help founders (especially if they've been in your shoes)Focus on finding people at least one degree of separation away from you (use LinkedIn's connection feature to check), and send them a thoughtful message asking for an introduction. Here‚Äôs a template you can use: SUBJECT: Quick question about connecting with [VC Partner]BODY:Hi [Connector's first name],I noticed your connection to [VC Partner/Firm] and wanted to reach out. I'm building [Company] [one-line description with traction point].We're raising our [round] and I believe [VC Partner] would be a great fit because [specific reason tied to their investment thesis/portfolio].Would you be open to making an introduction? I can send over a forwardable email to make it easy.Thanks for considering,TobyThis approach helped us secure over 50 investor meetings during our raise.The best advice I never got: Stop cold emailing investors. Start cold emailing the people who know them.What's been your experience with getting intros vs. cold emails? Drop it in the comments!",

    "content": "I wasted $250k because I assumed I'd raise VC to save me.That lost money has led me to one crucial understanding:The best thing early-stage founders can do is build as if VC doesn't exist.The VC-backed startup model follows a predictable pattern:1. Founders build massive teams before they're needed2. Companies raise more money than necessary3. Products are priced beyond their actual value4. Large amounts are wasted on paid ads and PR campaignsAs I built Chezie the assumption that I would need to raise VC led to some bad decision-making with hiring an expensive engineering team too soon, migrating from our low-code tech stack too early, and quitting my full-time job too quickly.The result? $250k in money that I wish I had back.But imagine a different approach:- Instead of quitting your job with no traction, work part-time on your idea until it generates enough revenue to support you.- Instead of building a large team right away, you hire contractors or part-time employees until full-time staff becomes absolutely necessary.- Instead of pricing your product to grow into your valuation, you price your products based on the actual value they provide, which also builds trust and loyalty with your customers.I am not anti-VC or against the traditional startup playbook. It works great for startups in super-competitive markets or capital-intensive industries like hardware.But 95% of founders would be better off building sustainable software businesses that don't follow this playbook.It's time to think beyond the old startup playbook‚Äîthere are many ways to win.",

    "content": "I blew 20 investor meetings before I finally understood how fundraising actually works.Here's what changed everything üëáüèæBEFORE:My pitch was straightforward:\"We've built an MVP, grown to 7 customers and $100K in ARR, and need $750K to hire engineers to rebuild our product off our no-code platform.\"Sounds solid, right?Wrong. I was making a classic founder mistake:I was telling investors how I'd spend their money, not how they'd make money.AFTER:Once I understood venture math, everything changed.My new pitch:\"We're at $100K ARR with 7 customers using a no-code MVP. With $750K, we'll grow to $750K ARR in 12 months - putting us in position to raise our seed round at 2-3x our current valuation.\"Here's why this works better:Pre-seed investors writing checks at $5M valuations need to believe you can raise your next round at $10M+.Why?Because they need to show their LPs (limited partners) that they're making good bets. Happy LPs = more money for their next fund.The takeaway: Your job as a founder isn't to convince investors you'll build a great product.Your job is to convince them you'll hit the metrics needed to raise your next round at a higher valuation.Remember: VCs aren't buying your current business.They're buying your next round and all the rounds after that until you become a unicorn. The sooner you understand that, the sooner you'll close that pre-seed ü§ùüèæP.S. - I broke this down in detail in my free CREAM e-book. It's a 62-page guide to raising VC for first-time founders.

    "content": "For first-time founders, it‚Äôs hard to make hiring decisions based on interviews alone. Anyone can practice answers to \"tell me about a time when...\" questions.That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve started doing (paid) assessments for every new FT or contract hire.Here's how we run our recruiting assessments at Chezie üëáüèæ1. Be upfront about the assessmentInclude it in the job post or initial screener. This respects everyone's time - some candidates won't want to do an assessment, and that's fine. Better to know early.2. Keep your candidate pool smallOnly send assessments to 2-3 top candidates. Any more than that and you're wasting people's time (and your money).3. Design the right challengeAsk yourself:\"What would I want this person to accomplish in their first 30 days?\"Then scale it down to:\"What's the smallest version of this they could do in an hour?\"Example: When hiring a UX designer recently, we asked candidates to mock up a landing page for our upcoming Goals feature. Simple and relevant.4. Set clear expectationsSend a Loom video explaining:‚Ä¢ The exact deliverable‚Ä¢ Examples of how to approach it‚Ä¢ Time limit (max 2 hours)‚Ä¢ Payment details5. Review work togetherHave candidates walk you through their process. This reveals:‚Ä¢ How they think‚Ä¢ How they communicate‚Ä¢ How they handle feedback6. Pay for their timeThis is non-negotiable. If you're asking for work, you need to pay for it. Our formula: Pay either their projected hourly rate or $150 for the assessment, whichever is higher.Why? Because asking for free work starts the relationship off on the wrong foot.¬†And it's just The best part about this process is that you actually see how people work before you hire them. Worst case, you don‚Äôt like any of the responses and you‚Äôre out $300. That‚Äôs way better than hiring someone and having to fire them within the first few weeks üôÉWhat hiring tips have worked for you?

Connecting with entrepreneurs building real businesses on their terms is always dope.No huge funding rounds or fancy tech stacks - just pure hustle and execution.Take Shanise Thomason, founder of Tressed. Shanise:‚Ä¢ Built a $500K+ revenue business before touching tech‚Ä¢ Is getting ready to raise $1.2M pre-seed‚Ä¢ Previously had a company acquired in 2016‚Ä¢ Currently doing $16K/month in salesAll of this with no outside funding. Just relentless focus on serving customers and generating revenue.I did more listening than talking, but here are some of the things I shared with the founders:1. When investors ask about valuation early, give a range ($5-7M) instead of a specific number ($6M). This shows that you've considered it while leaving room for negotiation.2. Don't wait until your tech is perfect. Validate your idea with service businesses first, then add tech later.3. When working with contractors, always use project-based billing instead of hourly rates. Contractors tend to take their time if you pay by the hour.4. When fundraising, your story needs three elements:‚Ä¢ Personal connection to the problem‚Ä¢ Clear market opportunity‚Ä¢ Why you're the right person to solve itIf you‚Äôre an early-stage founder with questions about funding or getting off the ground, subscribe to my newsletter, and I'll announce the next set of office hours sessions first!Link: https://lnkd.in/dYFy-XTg\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "Only 0.05% of startups founders successfully raise venture capital.That's 1 in every 10,000 founders.If you want to improve your odds, you have to prioritize your investors. Here‚Äôs how I did it to successfully close my pre-seed üëáüèæYou often hear that fundraising is like sales. While they aren‚Äôt 100% similar, a through line is that, like in sales, not every prospect is equal. Successful founders prioritize their target funds before they start raising. To make it simple, categorize investors by four categories: location, stage, sector, and (most importantly) whether or not you can get a warm intro.Then, prioritize with this framework:Low priority: Match on one criteria (location, stage, or sector)Medium priority: Match on 2-3 criteriaHigh priority: Match on all three + clear path to warm introA key point is that the status of a fund does NOT equal priority. For example, a notable fund like Andressen Horowitz is, on paper, a good fit for my company Chezie:- They invest in B2B SaaS ‚úì- They invest in pre-seed/seed stages ‚úì- They've backed other HR tech companies like ChartHop ‚úìBut I put them as medium priority because I didn‚Äôt have anyone who could introduce me. Sure, I could send a cold email, but since warm intros matter so much, not having one meant that prioritizing them would probably be a waste of time. Raising VC is about getting momentum. Prioritizing funds means that you save the best for last. This means that by the time you get to that perfect-fit, high-priority fund:1. You know your pitch forward and backward2. You have responses to every question that a VC is going to ask3. You *might* even have a commitment from another fund to create some real FOMO for that investorInvestors won‚Äôt say this but the best chance you have to get a check is the first meeting you have. Prioritize your funds so you‚Äôre pitching your top targets when you‚Äôre most ready. For other founders who‚Äôve raised, how did you go about prioritizing investors?

    "content": "When I started my company I got a crash course in product management. 3 years later, I can confidently say this is the biggest thing I‚Äôve learned:Be 10x better, or don‚Äôt bother. When building a startup, you're not just fighting other tools; you're fighting 'the way we've always done it.'Think about it:‚Ä¢ Users have existing processes‚Ä¢ Teams have muscle memory‚Ä¢ Change can mean retraining an entire organizationYou need to be dramatically better to take users away from their current process. Not a little bit better. Not twice as good.10x better.Here's an example from our latest feature Chezie:We're building a Slack integration that lets ERG leaders broadcast messages to their groups. We had two options:1. Ship a basic plain-text message builder quickly2. Build a full drag-and-drop Slack block kit builderThe easy path is option 1. But we asked ourselves:\"If we just offer plain text, why would our users stop typing directly in Slack?\"They wouldn't.So we're building a proper block kit builder that makes creating Slack messages as intuitive as building emails.Yes, it's taking longer.Yes, it's more complex.But it will be 10x better than simply sending messages directly in Slack. The takeaway is that in B2B software, changing tools means changing ingrained habits - not just for one person, but for entire teams.To make your buyers adopt your product you need to be 10x better than the existing process.\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

A lack of transparency about it is.Seeing a lot of debate about this Inc. article about a founder promoting an intense startup culture.Here's my take: founders can build whatever company culture they want.These founders have every right to:‚Ä¢ Work 80-hour weeks‚Ä¢ Reply to weekend texts‚Ä¢ Be available 24/7Will those founders probably miss out on awesome talent that has kids or is a caregiver or has a disability or just has a life outside of work‚Ä¶?Yes. But that's their choice.Just like its the candidate‚Äôs choice to decide if that‚Äôs the type of environment they want to work in. The problem isn't the intense culture. It's the bait and switch during recruiting.Whenever we‚Äôre hiring for Chezie I try to be explicit with our working expectations. We recently hired a contract developer, and I shared these requirements:‚Ä¢ Daily standups at 2pm ET‚Ä¢ Active hours: 10am-4pm‚Ä¢ 15-min Slack response time during work hoursDifferent founders have different ways they want to approach their companies. Some need that 24/7 intensity to achieve their goals.But candidates deserve to know what they're signing up for.Be transparent about your expectations.Let candidates decide if your culture fits their life.Then own whatever culture you build.If you‚Äôre building a company, you can build whatever type of culture you think will lead to the results that you want. Whatever that culture looks like, the key is to CLEAR about your working style. Your future employees will thank you.What do you think? Should founders be able to build whatever culture they want as long as they're transparent about it? üëáüèæ\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "Founders who raise a pre-seed, seed, and series A end up owning less than 50% of their companies. There‚Äôs a way to build a big business and retain 80%+ ownership: the one-and-one round of funding. Here‚Äôs how it works üëáüèæA typical VC-backed company raises three rounds of funding by Series A:- Pre-seed: to validate the idea- Seed: to validate the GTM- Series A: to validate the marketThis usually looks like:‚Ä¢ Pre-seed ($300K at $3M post)‚Ä¢ Seed ($1M at $5M post)‚Ä¢ Series A ($5M+ at $20M post)By Series A, the founders have been diluted to own about 50% of their company.With the one-and-done route, founders can get to market validation and still own 80% of their company. Instead of raising a pre-seed, hustle to get the company off the ground:- Build with no-code tools instead of hiring a developer- Offer services to customers to get revenue- Consider keeping your day job so you don‚Äôt have to worry about paying yourselfIt might take a bit longer, but founders who follow this path should be able to grow to $100k+ ARR and have an idea of how they can get to $500k or $1M. Now, it‚Äôs time to raise the ONE round. Let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs $1M on a $5M valuation. That‚Äôs 20% dilution. The founders are in the same spot as those who follow the traditional route, with one big difference:They own 80% of their company. With $1M in funding and a validated idea, these founders can hit the gas peddle.‚Ä¢ Double down on what's working‚Ä¢ Aim for 100-200% YoY growth‚Ä¢ Stay efficient with capital‚Ä¢ Build toward profitabilityWhen it‚Äôs time to raise a Series A, the founders have optionality.If you want to raise to grow faster, go for it. If you like the way things are going, then don‚Äôt raise. Here's why this matters:Traditional path = Always raising, heavily dilutedOptimal path = Control your destiny, keep your equityYour company doesn't need three rounds to succeed. It needs sustainable growth and founders who maintain control.- - - Thanks to Calvin Rupango for the inspiration for this post!\n      \n    \n  \n          \n          ‚Ä¶more",

    "content": "DEI is done!‚Ä¶At least, according to LinkedIn. I usually don‚Äôt post about DEI work because going back and forth with people here is exhausting, but yall are doing a lot, so here we go. With Chezie‚Äôs Cycles feature, we can see how much companies have budgeted year over year for their ERGs. While not 100% representative, it does give us a good representation of DEI budgets overall. Some insights:- From 2023 to 2024, budgets decreased by 2.89%- From 2024 to 2025, budgets decreased by 2.47%Is DEI spending down?Yes. But I‚Äôd be willing to bet that every department is having their budget cut by AT LEAST 2-5% this year. The truth is this:DEI is at a point where it only makes news when a company pulls back. You almost never see a company make the news for maintaining or increasing their DEI commitments because the big outlets don‚Äôt want to cover that. Case in point:Meta shut down its DEI programs last week, and EVERY major news outlet (Axios, CNN, CNBC, The Guardian) had something to say about it.Costco (the üêê brand, IMO) doubled down on DEI, and the only semi-major media outlet to cover it was Bloomberg.The moral of the story - Everybody relax. DEI is fine. It‚Äôs evolving, and changes are being made, but that‚Äôs how every department within a company works. There goes my one DEI post of the year. I hope you enjoyed it!",

Here‚Äôs how we did itüëáüèæEven if you don‚Äôt want to raise VC, every founder should raise a friends and family round. It‚Äôs an opportunity to create wealth for the people in your life that are cheering you on.How did we go about raising the round? Like everything else, it was a process:1. I contacted my friends and family to let them know that we were fundraising and to ask if they were interested. I made it clear that there was no pressure whatsoever. At this point, we‚Äôd been working on Chezie for about 2 years, so folks knew about the company.2. Next, we worked with our legal counsel (shoutout Mission Law) to open a roll-up vehicle (RUV) via AngelList. An RUV lets people invest via a debit card and sets up the round so it‚Äôs ONE line on your cap table.3. When we got interest, my co-founder Dumebi Egbuna and I scheduled an open pitch via Zoom. We treated it like a VC pitch. We showed people:- Problem/Solution- Financial projections- Competition- Go-to-market+ everything else that goes into a traditional pitchThere were about 20 people on that call. At the end, we opened the floor for Q&A. We shared the RUV link with everyone after the meeting.4. Over the next two months, I answered questions from those who were interested. I didn‚Äôt care that some people would invest just $1,000. This support was essential to me, and I felt responsible for ensuring they were comfortable investing.To our disbelief, there was over $150k in the RUV after two months.We had parents of friends invest their money on top of what their kids put in. A friend of mine invested, got a raise at her job, and then invested some more. I get emotional just thinking about it. The money from our friends and family plus what we raised from VCs and other investors carried us through our goal of $750k.Many underrepresented founders don‚Äôt bother trying to raise a friends and family because they don‚Äôt think their network will be willing/able to invest.My number one piece of advice is this:Let your friends and family decide that for themselves.The people who have supported you from day one deserve a chance to invest. Give them that chance by opening your round to friends and family.---I created a free guide that explains this process step by step.

    "content": "Only 2.2% of VC funding went to women founders in 2024.Black founders? 0.48%. LGBTQ+ founders? 0.5%.If VCs actually want to improve these numbers (big if), here are 5 things they could start doing:1. Ban the warm introYou can't get warm intros without social capital. And underrepresented founders often lack the networks that make this possible. As long as access to capital requires social capital, diverse founders are going to take an L.2. Be direct with your \"no\"- \"Let me know when you have a lead investor\"- \"You're too early for us\"- \"Keep us updated on your progress\"These are all indirect ways of saying no. So instead of beating around the bush, just say you‚Äôre not interested so founders can pursue investors who are genuinely interested.3. Give real feedbackDon't say that the \"metrics aren't there.\" Tell us which metrics matter and what benchmarks you're looking for. Specific feedback helps founders improve and better understand what investors want.4. Look beyond SF and NYCWhen you only invest in major tech hubs, you're saying you only want founders who can afford $4K/month rent. Remember: Mailchimp ($12B), Calendly ($3B), and Duo Security ($2.35B) weren't built in SF.5. Diversify LP basesIt makes sense that diverse LPs would lead to diverse founders. They bring different networks, understand overlooked markets, and can better evaluate opportunities in their communities.Will any of this happen? Probably not.These changes would mean disrupting systems that work really well for VCs and their existing networks. It would cost them traditional deal flow and require more work.But maybe in 2025, we'll see some brave firms try something different.Until then, we‚Äôll keep building, growing, and finding ways to succeed despite the barriers.Founders: What other changes could help improve funding access for underrepresented founders?
