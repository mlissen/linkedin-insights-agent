- Review your calls regularly, whether weekly or bi-weekly, to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement in your pitch
- Adjust your pitch deck, delivery, and focus based on the insights gathered from analyzing your recorded calls
- Think carefully about the implications of taking VC funding and what it means for your pricing and growth strategy.
- Consider alternative funding approaches, such as bootstrapping or raising at a more realistic valuation, in order to maintain control over your pricing and offer genuine value to customers.
- Benchmark your pricing against competitors, especially those who have not taken VC funding, to ensure you are offering a competitively-priced product.
- When evaluating a term sheet, do not solely focus on the valuation. Also carefully consider the board composition and control, liquidation preferences, and anti-dilution provisions to ensure you are protecting yourself and your business.
- Try not to give up a board seat before your Seed round, and ideally before your Series A, to maintain more control over the company in the early stages.
- Aim for a 1x liquidation preference, as this ensures a fair distribution of proceeds in the event of an acquisition or IPO.
- Reach out to venture capital funds and request detailed feedback on your pitch, even if they decline to invest.
- Maintain open communication with investors throughout the fundraising process to reduce founder anxiety.
- Ask investors to introduce you to other potential investors, even if they decide not to fund your startup.

Most founders quit after 30.Here is how to calculate the number of funds you need to identify before you raise VC. ⬇️Your investor pipeline is a list of funds and angel investors you want to invest in your round.

I wasted $250k because I assumed I'd raise VC to save me.That lost money has led me to one crucial understanding:The best thing early-stage founders can do is build as if VC doesn't exist.The VC-backed startup model follows a predictable pattern:1. Founders build massive teams before they're needed2. Companies raise more money than necessary3. Products are priced beyond their actual value4. Large amounts are wasted on paid ads and PR campaignsAs I built Chezie the assumption that I would need to...

The founder of Snapchat just dropped the most powerful fundraising advice I've heard in a long time.In a recent episode of How I Built This with Guy Raz, Evan Spiegel mentioned that in his early days raising VC, he realized very early on that there are 3 things you can optimize for when raising money:1. The investors themselves2. The terms you get3. The valuationFirst-time founders only get to pick 2.Pick valuation + terms?- Pros: you get to say your startup is worth whatever you want, and you p...

After months of rejections from potential investors, a founder jumped off the VC flywheel and scaled a $60 million ARR business. Then he raised $350 million.Here's a story you might not know: The founder of Calendly, Tope Awotona, faced repeated rejections while trying to raise money from VCs. Like all great founders do, Tope pressed on in spite of these setbacks. He was eventually able to raise $550k — then, instead of continuing down the fundraising rabbit hole, he focused on building a great ...

After 100+ pitches to VCs, I can confidently say that Harlem Capital was the most equity-focused in its diligence process. Here are three things Harlem Capital Partners (HCP) did that I think all VC funds should work into their processes 👇In 2022, I pitched Chezie to HCP. While they ultimately declined to invest, their approach left a lasting impression on me.1.

Founders are often advised to “hire the best people,” which sounds good in theory but isn’t realistic for most. Here’s why this advice misses the mark:Early on with Chezie, I posted an engineering role with a $120K salary. A Silicon Valley leader straight-up told me, “That’s pretty low; you’ll have trouble recruiting.” And she was right. Most applicants were junior devs, not the “rockstar” hires investors envision. And as I saw other founders making high-profile hires, I noticed a pattern: nearl...

Here's why first-time founders should identify 300+ funds to raise their first $1M ⬇️Building your investor pipeline isn't about finding a handful of "perfect fit" funds.It's about understanding the (pretty low) conversion rates at each stage of the funnel.When I raised our pre-seed for Chezie, for every 10 investors on our target list, I got a meeting with only 3 of them - a 30% target-to-meeting convers...
