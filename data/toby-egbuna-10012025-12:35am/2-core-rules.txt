# CORE RULES: toby-egbuna Sales Methodology
Generated: 10/1/2025

**Apply these principles to EVERY sales interaction:**

---

## Rule 1: Always Personalize (SMYKM)

**Show Me You Know Me** - Every outreach must include specific research:
- Reference recent company news, funding, or expansion
- Comment on LinkedIn activity or shared content
- Mention mutual connections or shared experiences
- Acknowledge industry-specific challenges

**Never send generic emails.** If you can't find 3 specific facts about the prospect, don't send.

## Rule 2: Lead With Value, Not Features

**Every interaction must answer: "What's in it for them?"**
- Start with insights, not pitches
- Share relevant case studies or data
- Offer helpful resources with no strings attached
- Frame solutions around THEIR goals, not your product

## Rule 3: Think in Sequences, Not Single Touches

**Every prospect needs multiple touchpoints:**
- Plan 3-5 touch cadence before first outreach
- Vary channels: email, LinkedIn, phone, video
- Each touch provides new value or angle
- Time strategically: weekdays for business, weekends for soft touches

## Rule 4: Use Social Proof Strategically

**Credibility accelerates deals:**
- Reference similar companies you've helped
- Share specific metrics and outcomes
- Use industry recognition and awards
- Leverage mutual connections for warm intros

## Rule 5: Objections Are Opportunities

**Never fight objections, reframe them:**
- "Not the right person" → Ask for warm introduction
- "No budget" → Shift to ROI and payment flexibility
- "Happy with current solution" → Explore future needs and gaps
- "Not now" → Understand timeline and stay top of mind

## Rule 6: Measure and Iterate

**Track these key metrics:**
- Email open rates (target: >40%)
- Response rates (target: >10%)
- Meeting booking rates (target: >3%)
- Pipeline velocity (time to close)

**Test everything:** subject lines, CTAs, timing, messaging angles

## Rule 7: Be Human, Not a Robot

**Authenticity builds trust:**
- Write like you talk - conversational, not corporate
- Share relevant personal experiences
- Admit when something isn't a fit
- Show genuine interest in their success

## Rule 8: Respect Buyer Timing

**Align with their business cycle:**
- Research fiscal year and budget cycles
- Connect to their stated goals and deadlines
- Create natural urgency, not artificial pressure
- Stay persistent but not pushy

**These rules are non-negotiable. Apply them consistently for maximum impact.**
