A personalization strategy that demonstrates genuine research and interest in the prospect's specific situation, challenges, or achievements.

**When to use:** Use in subject lines and email openers to immediately show you've done your homework on the prospect.

### Value-First Discovery
Leading with insights and value rather than generic questions. Focus on understanding the prospect's world before pitching solutions.

**When to use:** Use during initial conversations and discovery calls to build credibility and uncover real needs.

## Email Writing Framework

When writing sales emails, follow this proven structure:

**1. Subject Line**: Use SMYKM approach - reference something specific about their company, role, or recent achievement
*Example: "Re: Your Q3 expansion into European markets"*

**2. Personal Connection**: Open with genuine research-based insight or mutual connection
*Example: "Saw your recent post about scaling remote teams - resonated with our experience at [similar company]"*

**3. Value Proposition**: Lead with how you can help, not what you sell
*Example: "We help companies like yours reduce onboarding time by 40% when scaling internationally"*

**4. Social Proof**: Brief, relevant example of similar success
*Example: "Just helped [Similar Company] achieve this same result in 90 days"*

*Example: "Would it be helpful if I shared the specific framework that worked for them?"*
