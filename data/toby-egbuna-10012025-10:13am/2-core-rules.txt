Generated: 10/1/2025

**Apply these principles to every fundraise and investor interaction:**

---

## Rule 1: Start With Investor Fit

**Only pitch investors who match your stage and thesis:**
- Map their fund size, check size, and lead preferences
- Confirm portfolio relevance and recent investments
- Prioritize warm paths through founders, angels, or operators
- Track every touchpoint so no intro goes cold

## Rule 2: Lead With Traction, Not Vision Alone

**Open every conversation with proof of momentum:**
- Highlight revenue, growth rate, retention, and pipeline strength
- Translate customer wins into quantified outcomes
- Share operational efficiency metrics (burn, runway, payback)
- Anchor valuation asks to investor-grade benchmarks

## Rule 3: Tell a Crisp Founder Narrative

**Frame the problem, insight, and why now in under two minutes:**
- Connect personal story to market gap and customer pain
- Show unique insight or unfair advantage the team owns
- Present market sizing with bottom-up validation
- Close with the future vision tied to investor upside

## Rule 4: Run a Structured Process

**Treat fundraising like a pipeline, not a series of ad-hoc chats:**
- Build a tiered target list before launch
- Batch outreach to create momentum and competitive tension
- Time diligence materials, updates, and asks intentionally
- Keep weekly operating reviews on investor funnel health

## Rule 5: Warm Intros and Social Proof Win

**Investors follow conviction signals:**
- Secure champion founders or operators to share the story
- Reference customer logos, retention, and usage metrics early
- Share advisory board or strategic partner endorsements
- Surface prior investor attention without overplaying it

## Rule 6: Prep Diligence Before You Need It

**Data room readiness builds trust and shortens cycles:**
- Keep financial model, metrics, and cohort analyses current
- Document product roadmap, GTM motion, and hiring plan
- Collect legal, HR, and cap table documents in one hub
- Rehearse answers to known diligence patterns by stage

## Rule 7: Manage Momentum Relentlessly

**Silence kills dealsâ€”rhythm sustains them:**
- Send investor updates within 24 hours of every meeting
- Package product, customer, and team wins as proof points
- Set clear next steps with dates before ending calls
- Use weekly updates to reinforce velocity and urgency

## Rule 8: Treat Objections as Insight

**Every pushback reveals what investors still need:**
- Log objections by theme (market, team, traction, competition)
- Answer with data, not defensiveness, and follow up with proof
- Update pitch materials when patterns emerge
- Stay on calendar even after a "pass" with brief progress updates

**These rules are non-negotiable. Apply them consistently to build investor trust and momentum.**
